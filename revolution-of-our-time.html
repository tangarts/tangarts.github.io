<article><p>"But half of the T-shirts I own are black &hellip;" </p>
<p>I didn't give much thought to the political situation before flying out.
Flights were booked and in my mind, Hong Kong was home for the next 10 months.
Protests simmering over summer weren't going away. One side, had to give. </p>
<p>An aptly named Special Administration Region, Hong Kong had been surrendered by
China to the British on a 99-year lease. In 1997, the transition began with the
establishment of the "One country, two systems"  policy, lasting until 2047 in
which the handover would be complete. During this period, outlined in Chapter
1, Article 5 of the constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of
life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The erosion of this common law happens while our governments and large
institutions ignore.</p>
<p>I remember 3 years prior, my first time as a sightseer on the A11 bus from the
Chek Lap Kok Airport. As we passed across the Tsing Ma bridge, high-rise
buildings emerged in the distance, growing as we ventured further into the
heart of Hong Kong. I looked out of the window and up. Monolithic tower blocks
loomed over me like the opening scene of Akira. Shouldered together in clusters
they formed mansions, estates and homes. Squeezed between a supermarket and a
medicinal shop, steam waft from the bamboo baskets of a food vendor. In the
same frame, meter-wide circular trays sat outside a dried food shop, scattered
with shrimp. The smell, off putting for some, memorable to say the least.</p>
<p>Spanning the majority of the Island, Hong Kong Tramways operates as strident as
the first journey in 1904. No wider than the shoulder width of 3 adults, the
tram system is frequented by locals and tourists. On a day without
responsibility, ride the full 26km circuit from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan
and back. Observe the speed at which the world around moves, time is money and
so is space.</p>
<p>Connecting Hong Kong to its most remote districts, the MTR rivals the
efficiency and cleanliness of Singapore's MRT and Tokyo's Metro. Buses run here
too. The service worth noting are the little green or red minibus rocket ships
&mdash; the red ones especially. Without check-pointed stops, one must <em>shout</em>
where to get off &hellip; in Cantonese of course, or continue the ride on the
world's most cortisol-raising mode of public transport. </p>
<p>Asking a local friend what to do with my free time, she replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eat." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 3 a.m dim sum to afternoon tea at the Peninsula, it is hard to find an
hour without thinking about food. With 92% of GDP composed of services,
fulfilling your daydreams and stomach is never an issue; spending a leisurely
hour on a bowl of cart noodles, is, however. If warm service and patient staff
are <em>essential</em> to your meal experience, there are plenty of expat-friendly
places that'd gladly offer you an international experience. Old Hong Kong has
no time or space to entertain.</p>
<p>Owing to the hilly topology, there's no shortage of mountains and peaks in
which the world is seen with childlike awe. Any mountain, hill or peak you
choose (the 19th floor New College pantry anyone?) land, sea and concrete
civilization awaits you at the top. For the adventurous, Hong Kong is hard to
disappoint;  a variety of hiking trails are scattered across the terrain to
roam and explore. </p>
<p>Sunsets, high and low are once again novel. The wet marshlands of Pak Nai
overlooks to the Shenzhen special economic zone; sun rays reflect off the
marshland plains creating a mirror world below the horizon. The focus shifts to
the mainland after dusk &mdash; across the sea, Shenzhen illuminates the night
with a white halogen glow. The future is just across the water.</p>
<h4>11/11</h4>
<p>Mistrust towards the Hong Kong police force grew stronger as the police
increased their aggression on the protestors and the death of Alex Chow, a
HKUST student. On the night before the planned general strike, the police force
stormed a university hall and arrested a student. In response to the invasion,
the universities across Hong Kong barricaded their campuses; road blocks
followed. Peaceful protests continued throughout the week, office workers on
the streets in Central and malls echoing chants of support. Hong Kong's youth,
taking centre stage.</p>
<p>West Gate entrance, the University of Hong Kong. As police progressed towards
the East gate exit, protestors strengthened their hold on the entrances to the
campus. The empty street decorated with bricks, each block propped upon two
others like legs. By midnight, from Flora Ho to HKU Exit C1, Pok Fu Lam heard
no sirens, all vehicles were re-routed around the campus.</p>
<p>A car approaches, stops and leaves.</p>
<p>"They've come to deliver supplies. Food, masks, helmets, water &hellip;" </p>
<p>There were students no older than 18 at the lookout posts, what do their
parents think? </p>
<p>"The ones outside support them. When they were our age they fought the same
struggle we did. It's the revolution of our time." </p>
<h4>Chapter 1, Article 1:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the
People's Republic of China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For better or for worse, China will not back away from what is theirs. The
people of Hong Kong kindle the flame of hope. However small it is.</p>
<h4>2047.</h4>
<p>To some it can't arrive any faster.</p>
<p>To anyone who can, see for yourself what it is before it is no more.</p></article>
