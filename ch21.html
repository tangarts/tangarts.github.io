<h1> Chapter 21 </h1>

<div class=date> 
</div>
<div><p>Dear Bond, </p>
<p>Here I am again sitting down to write and not knowing what I am
going to write about. Yesterday was the hardest day I've had 
here so far. Nothing special happened, it's just that I started
really longing for my freedom. Today my road work was so hard
that I had to divide it up into three sections and run both in 
the morning and again between 10:30 and 11:30 in order to be 
able to finish it. </p>
<p>I'm tired. </p>
<p>Oh well, kids in Africa are starving so let's get started. I 
still am stuck to let's see. Hmn? Maybe it's time we talked
about propositions. Propositions are very important. They are
the "deal" you are offering. For example: One deal might be that 
if you buy one item you get another item free. Another example 
of a proposition is the one used by the record and book clubs. 
It goes like this: "You can have any 10 records you want right 
now for only 99Â¢ if you agree to buy an additional record every 
other month for the next two years." Another very common "deal"
or proposition is: "If you buy right away you will get a big 
discount." And another is: "I'll give you a discount if you buy
more than one." And, of course, the most common proposition of 
all is simply: "If you give me X dollars I will give you X 
product!"</p>
<p>Propositions are very important in DM and MO selling and a very
important ingredient in making your propositions work is the 
"reason why". In other words when you say in effect, "Have I got 
a deal for you!" you need an explanation as to why you are 
offering this good deal. </p>
<p>You see, if you don't have an explanation, your "deal" won't be
believable and you may not get the sale. </p>
<p>Here are some common explanations for good deals:</p>
<p>"I'm going out of business." </p>
<p>"I just had a fire and I'm having a fire sale."</p>
<p>"I'm crazy." (all used car dealers)</p>
<p>"I owe taxes and I've got to raise money fast to pay them."</p>
<p>"I've lost my lease and I've got to sell this merchandise
right away before it gets thrown into the sheet."</p>
<p>"I've got to make space for some new merchandise that is 
arriving soon so I will sell you what I have on hand real
cheap."</p>
<p>And so on. All of these explanations work and that's why they
are used all the time. However, there is a far more compelling 
"excuse for a deal" and if you can find a way to use it you can
dramatically increase your sales volume. </p>
<p>You know what? I just thought of something else you can do to
make your copy more effective so I am going to take a detour 
here and tell you about it before I forget. Don't worry. We'll 
come back to propositions in a minute. </p>
<p>Anyway, a couple paragraphs back I wrote: "and if you can find a 
way to use it, you can dramatically increase your sales volume." </p>
<p>Now, compare that to this: "and if you can find a way to use it, 
you can make yourself a bushel of money!"</p>
<p>Isn't that a lot more powerful? You bet! The words "dramatically 
increase your sales volume" do not even begin to conjure up the
visual imagery of "a bushel of money." </p>
<p>So, write like that. Bring your story down to earth and hit 'em
where they live. (In their hearts and their pocketbooks!)</p>
<p>Well, Bondo, I just came up from my visit with you and Eric and
it sure was good to see both of you. You know, a lot of people 
believe it would be better for all concerned if I never had a
relationship with {name deleted} again. And, they may very well
be right. But I can't help it; I love her and I miss her like
crazy. </p>
<p>And, as you probably know, Eric told me she's seeing another guy 
now. I can't blame her. We are broken up and I always told her 
anyway that I didn't want her to wait around for me. </p>
<p>But boy it sure hurts. </p>
<p>And, once again, I'm writing about it because it releases me a 
little bit. You know, kiddo, you can't always control what 
happens to you in life but you do have a lot of control over 
your responses.</p>
<p>So what do I do to deal with this hurt? I write. I do my road
work. I do my chores. I don't snivel. And mainly:</p>
<p><strong>I Just Keep On</strong> 
<strong>Keepin' On</strong> </p>
<p>What else? I mean, unless you're going to take the pipe there
really is no other rational choice.</p>
<p>And so, we'll talk about that extraordinarily effective excuse 
for a deal. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>I Am Offering You</strong>
<strong>This Deal Because You</strong>
<strong>(By Virtue Of Some Unique Circumstance)</strong>
<strong>Are So Special</strong></p>
<p>This bears a little explanation. Listen to this: Once upon a 
time I wrote a letter to sell a family crest wall plaque. This 
letter contained a photograph of the wall plaque just like I 
have talked about doing and what that letter told my reader was
something like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. So and So, </p>
<p><br><br>
I thought you would like to see what the So and So family 
crest looks like in full color so I am sending you the
enclosed wall plaque. </p>
<p><br><br>
The reason we have the So &amp; So wall plaque in stock is
because we needed to take some pictures of our products for 
publicity purposes and So &amp; So is one of the family crests
we used when making our samples.</p>
<p><br><br>
However, now that we are finished with our PR campaign we 
have this plaque in stock with your family crest. </p>
<p><br><br>
And, since we can't sell this wall plaque to anybody unless 
they are named So &amp; So we have a very limited (as you know, 
there aren't many So &amp; So's) market for it. 
<br><br>
And, therefore, since your name is So &amp; So we'd like to 
offer it to you at a true and honest discount of X percent! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did this approach work? Wow! Did it ever! Like...</p>
<p><strong>40 Million In Sales!</strong></p>
<p>You know, I'm sad and it's hard right now to keep on keepin' on
but that's what I'm going to do. </p>
<p>And so, as you can see, in that last example I found a way to
show my customers that he was unique and valuable to me. Now,
let's see if we can come up with some other ideas along this 
line: For example: </p>
<p>"I'm offering you this special deal because your trade in is a 
1976 Gas Sucker and I have a customer who wants that car.
Therefore, I'm willing to break even on the sale to you make my
profit from the other guy."</p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><em>"Since you are one of the world's leading gynecologists we feel
you are in a unique position to appreciate this picture book of
unusual..."</em></p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><em>"Since you have proven yourself to be an astute judge of art, we 
are willing to send you these paintings at half price but only 
if you will give us your opinion in writing."</em></p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><em>"A mutual friend of ours, Tom Smith, said I should write you 
because, he says, you are the best judge of value of a book like 
this that he knows."</em></p>
<p>Onward. Onward. Onward.</p>
<p>I'm hurting and the radio is playing "Amazing Grace" by, I 
think, Linda Ronstat. Damn! Life gets tough sometimes! </p>
<p>Here's more. How about this opening: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. So &amp; So,</p>
<p><br><br>
I have attached a dollar bill to the top of this letter for two
reasons. 
 <br><br>
First, I needed some way to get your attention because,
secondly, I have a very important message for you and every
other real estate agent in L.A. County. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. So &amp; So,</p>
<p><br><br>
Did you know there are only 117 So &amp; So families in the entire 
U.S.?</p>
<p><br><br>
Yes, it's true. And, because you are one of them, blah, blah,
etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I Love You And Good Luck!</p>
<p>Dad</p>
