The year of connection, I've decided on the theme for next year.

[Connection](connection).

First off, how did the year of creating go?

In exploring this years theme I managed to create a personal CRM, starting with
a [personal database](https://sive.rs/dbt), expanded functionality with Django
and a web interface.  
I highly recommend looking at [Monica](https://www.monicahq.com/) for a complete,
maintained project.

I've also tinkered with Common Lisp during the summer, published only 10 posts
since choosing the theme, there is still time! My list of unpublished _has_
increased and the frequency of note taking increased too.

This has helped as I moved to learning Clojure and ClojureScript for 
_real world projects_. Mostly web project and learning React via ClojureScript's
_Reagent_ and _Re-frame_ libraries. 

During the summer I managed to read more than a [handful of books](bookshelf).
Late spring saw me invest more time into reading, learning, discovering
interesting things on the internet. I managed to sign up on twitter hoping to
build connections of interesting individuals.

**I hoped to have written 100 tweets in 3 months** 

That didn't last long.

**I committed to writing more** 

Starting at the beginning of 2020 I set my theme as creating. Whilst I barely
managed to post one every month it wasn't a goal to stick to a regime. Now, of
course, writing every morning, I don't need to be as conscious of what I type,
the content is for my eyes only. Luckily there will be something that I feel
compelled to put up.

**I emailed an internet stranger for the first time**

I think that was an important turning point in the year, realizing there is
a community of who what to engage in discussion and experts who are willing to
reply to your queries. Less lurking, more posting for next year.

Continuing to expose myself to a variety of people on the internet has allowed
me to feel confident in what I am able to achieve. It is possible to create an
extraordinary life. Seeing others reassures me it can be done.

**What else?**

First internship. It was great working with [E2E](https://eng2eng.net/), 
working on adding features to their online engineering network. The founders
are an incredible leaders and have no doubt they will have a successful career
ahead of them.

[Travel](sunset). I was lucky enough to survive the first exodus of university
exchange students across Hong Kong. I spent the end of 2019 and beginning of
2020 in Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. The remaining time in Hong Kong was
more quiet, a drop in tourists and familiar faces hadn't returned over the
holiday.  
My intentional visit home mid March turned into an unexpected end to my time 
in Hong Kong. Even though I miss the excitement of travelling, I made the most
of my time.

In my personal life I finally had the courage to ask someone out. In the four
months I have been with her I have learnt how to be more forgiving, not jumping
to the worst possible outcome and realizing that life is not forever so enjoy
the present. Earlier this year, I concluded that regrets are something I do not
have, only lessons to be learnt from.

This year has shifted my view on valuing emotional intelligence or
interpersonal skill. I thought being a _people person_ wasn't required if your
skills were strong enough for an _analyst_ or a technical position.

How I was wrong.

I understand that the first impression I get at an interview is the only chance
I get at winning them over, comparing it to the feedback I get from peers,
I _do_ need to work on setting a better first impression. Smile more? It
doesn't _seem_ natural but it can be developed.

It also ties in with awareness, assuming a aware that your shoulders are
hunched, your eyes are avoiding the speaker in front of you. Noticing that your
physical posture is signalling to the person opposite you. Noticing that you
can change this very moment...

 
In the year of connecting, I hope to engage more in online discussions.

More on that later.
