### It's not too late for new years resolutions!

The [New Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar) have arrived
and I'm still without a goal to chase. An accomplishment to achieve by the end
of the year.

From the CGP Grey video I have decided to make it the year of creating.

Resolutions are hard rules to follow.  Humans aren't too good at sticking to
hard rules.  Instead, yearly themes are substituted as a way of defining our
yearly goals.

The beauty of themes is that they aren't strictly defined. This plays well with
ever changing goals and circumstances.

**So why creating?**

For months, I have been meaning to improve my ability to communicate well
through writing. So far, not much has been produced in terms of publishable
content. I hope to:
        
1. **Increase the amount of written files I produce.** Whether that is on daily
  entries on how I feel, technical topics accessible to anyone literate or an
  interesting insight that I would like to review and document in my own words.

2. **Refine and edit new and existing pieces.** Removing unnecessary words. Not
  being afraid of reading material from my past self.

It will be an interesting to see where the year of creativity will take me. 

What goals will I have achieved and how will I define creating in 12 months.  

To a year of creating!
