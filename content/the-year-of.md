### It's not too late for new years resolutions!

The New Year(s) have arrived and i

Taken from the [CGP Grey video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar) I have decided to make it the year of creating.

The premise of the video is that resolutions are hard rules to follow. 
Humans aren't too good at sticking to hard rules. 
Instead, yearly themes are substituted as a way of deifining our yearly goals.

The beauty of themes is that they aren't strictly defined. This plays well with ever changing goals and circumstances.

So why creating?

For months, I have been meaning to improve my ability to communicate well through writing. So far, not much has been produced in terms of publishable content. I hope to:

- *Increase the amount of written files I produce.* Whether that is on daily entries on how I feel, technical topics accessible to anyone literate or an interesting insight that I would like to review and document in my own words

- *Refine and edit* new and existing pieces. Removing unecessary words. Not being afraid of reading material from my past self.



It will be an interesting to see where the year of creativity will take me. What goals will I have achieved and how will I define creating in 12 months.

To a year of creating!
