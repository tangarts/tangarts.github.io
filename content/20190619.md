## Exploration in markdown

This article is a test post.
I'm currently trying to configure writing blog posts in markdown to be rendered to html. 

The blog will be an __exploration__ of the many novel or re-occurring thoughts I have.

At first, many of the posts will be reflection on interesting insights from other blogs or books.  
There will be heavy influences from the various blogs I frequently browse. Some notable mentions:    

- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers")
- [z3bra.org](http://blog.z3bra.org/)
- [paulgraham](http://paulgraham.com/ "Paul Graham")
- [melting Asphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/ "Kevin Simler")

I plan on creating a section on book notes (one step at a time!).

To wrap up, a few more **tests**

```
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

```

Finally a quote about ends:
