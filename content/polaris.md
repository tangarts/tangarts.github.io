You are unique. Do not align your trajectory with someone you aspire to. You are an explorer, a flaneur, they
are your polaris. Guiding you on your journey, not your end goal. 

What happens if you blindly follow the north star? --

I don't think I have ever written on a topic in isolation. All of my rough drafts are streams of conscious thought,
new ideas appearing mid sentence.
