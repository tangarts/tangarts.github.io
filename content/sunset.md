I've been thinking about sunsets recently and the lack of them [at home.]()

Why in the East, was I blessed to witness spectacular sunsets daily and now left with only memories of orange-hazed skies?

### Scattering

When white light passes through our atmosphere, gases in our atmosphere absorb and scatter the shorter wavelength (blue and violet). The scattered blue light thus illuminates the sky.

### Orange sky at night&hellip;

The light travelling from the sun near the horizon passes through more atmosphere to reach the observer. Blue light scatters multiple times, leaving longer wavelengths visible &mdash; the yellow, orange and reds found at sunrise and sunset.

### Clouds & Particles

Particles larger than oxygen and nitrogen molecules cause a reduction in saturation hence rural sunsets appear more vibrant.
