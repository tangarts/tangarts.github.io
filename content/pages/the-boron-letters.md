The Boron letters are a series of 25 letters, written by Gary Halbert to his
son Bond. Halbert, one of the greatest copywriters and pioneers of scientific
marketing, covers wisdom he has developed in his 46 years alive. It is a short
read, all 25 letters can be read in within a few hours yet contains advice most
people would benefit reading.

The [first letter](http://www.thegaryhalbertletter.com/Boron/BoronLetterCh1.htm) and the
other 24 can be found within the archives of his website though they are not
linked to each other and the '09 formatting is outdated. Across the internet
there are less than a handful of blog posts linking the complete series as an
index of sort. However, the online reading experience was bad so
I compiled the letters here, with new formatting for ease of reading and as
a project in improving my UX skills. 

All credit goes to Halbert and his artful advice. I highly recommend to check the
[archives](http://www.thegaryhalbertletter.com/newsletter-archives.htm) for
more of Halbert's writing. I also recommend buying a [print copy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Boron-Letters-Gary-C-Halbert/dp/1484825985) of
the Boron Letters as it is always nice to have a physical copy you can call _yours_.
