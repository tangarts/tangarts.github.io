Hi, I'm Nehemiah,

A mathematics undergrad with a drive to create. I believe ideas are [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII) and [traditions are underrated](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html) among other things.

Some of my academic interests include machine learning: its application in industry, meta-learning and interpretability.

Feel free to get in touch on twitter [@tangarts](https://twitter.com/tangarts) or by [email](mailto:nehemiahcampbell@hotmail.co.uk).
