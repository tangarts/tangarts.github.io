This valley wood is pledged  
To the set shape of things,  
And reasonably hedged:  
Here are no harpies fledged,  
No rocs may clap their wings,  
Nor gryphons wave their stings.  
Here, poised in quietude,  
Calm elementals brood  
On the set shape of things:  
They fend away alarms  
From this green wood.  
Here nothing is that harms â€“  
No bulls with lungs of brass,  
No toothed or spiny grass,  
No tree whose clutching arms  
Drink blood when travellers pass,  
No mount of glass;  
No bardic tongues unfold  
Satires or charms.  
Only, the lawns are soft,  
The tree-stems, grave and old;  
Slow branches sway aloft,  
The evening air comes cold,  
The sunset scatters gold.  
Small grasses toss and bend,  
Small pathways idly tend  
Towards no fearful end.
