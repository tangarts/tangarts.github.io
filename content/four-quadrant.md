A useful model for deciding priorites is by grouping tasks into four quadrants:

--- | ---
unimportant | important
not urgent  |   urgent

The system adds an extra degrees of freedom to a decision model:

**1.**  binary: yes/no decision

**2.**  priority list, scale of importance

**3.** four quadrant method, two axis of importance

**4.** ?

Thinking in higher dimensions...

## simplicity vs complex

- simple: easy to understand, straightforward
- complex: difficult to understand, convoluted

- advanced: does a lot, powerful
- basic: doesn't do much, simplistic

simple & basic

complicated & basic- avoid

complicated & advanced - sometimes necessary, state-of-the-art tech, helicopters

simple & advanced - physics, mathematics and designers

simple building blocks 
advanced behaviour often comes from simple parts. 
Unix design philosophy - many simple, basic programs that perform specific tasks well. chained via piping, can scale to perform complex feats
