How tall is my friend?

With this information you might ask for their name, ethnicity. The only prior information would be the distribution of humans, It is very unlikely that my friend is shorter than 3 ft or taller than 8 ft though not impossible.
A reasonable guess would be 5 ft 6 in. This is an approximate average height for both male and female.

Mathematically, we can express the height of my friend as $\theta$, and our estimate as a range of likely heights, bell-shaped and peaking around 5 ft 6 in. 

A little later I mention his name, [Oscar](https://www.behindthename.com/name/oscar) [Van Hautum](https://surnames.behindthename.com/name/van00hautum)

With 3 new pieces of information, you think he's taller than before, a Dutch male, you infer from the name, you have more confidence in thinking he is closer to 6 ft.

That's all well and reasonable but he's actually a cat.
