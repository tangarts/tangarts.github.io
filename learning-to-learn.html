<article><p><strong>Notes from the Coursera Course: Learning How to Learn</strong></p>
<h2>1. What is Learning</h2>
<p><strong>FOCUSED</strong> and <strong>DIFFUSE</strong> mode.</p>
<p>When learning, its best to make use of both modes, switching between focused and diffuse mode thinking.</p>
<p>When learning, there are times in which you are focused and times in which you allow your mind to wander.  </p>
<p>This unfocused, or diffused, mode is just as valuable as the focused mode in allowing your brain to LEARN something. </p>
<p>Take breaks, meditate, think about other things, and give yourself plenty of time in both modes.</p>
<p><strong>WORKING (short term)</strong> and <strong>LONG TERM</strong> memory</p>
<p><strong>SLEEP</strong> - vital.</p>
<h2>2. Chunking</h2>
<p>The act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information.</p>
<p>Don't always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung problem (a German word for Mindset). </p>
<p>An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found.  </p>
<p>Your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading. </p>
<p>You've to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.</p>
<ol>
<li>Master the main idea - survey and priming 
    — this involves scanning a book or the syllabus of a course, for example, to get a general idea of the bigger picture. </li>
<li>Observe an example. Then, do it yourself. </li>
<li>Finally, do it again and again in different contexts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Techniques</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recall</strong> - a couple of minutes to summarise/recall material you're trying to learn</li>
<li><strong>Bite sized Testing</strong> - test yourself as you encounter new material, Recall is a testing technique</li>
<li><strong>Interleaving</strong> - know when to apply a particular concept is as important as knowing how.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a></strong> - vary the frequency of revisiting material based on how well you can recall (<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not important to pass the test without mistakes. Mistakes and correcting them are important to solidify learning</p>
<p>Metaphors and analogies - Feynman technique</p>
<p>Brief notes that summarise key concepts are more effective that highlighting</p>
<p>Illusion of competence: don't repeat easy topics</p>
<h2>3. Procrastination and Memory</h2>
<h4>Procrastination</h4>
<p>Weekly/Daily list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your daily list the evening before. Not writing them down will take up valuable slots of memory.</li>
<li>Set aside 30–60 minutes every day for each task.</li>
<li>Plan your finishing time, just as important as planning your working time.</li>
<li>Eat the frog - Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.</li>
<li>Take notes about what works and what doesn't.</li>
<li>Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Memory</h4>
<p>Creativity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A better short term/working memory makes it harder to be creative. it is more likely to experience Einstellung as it will pick up new concepts very quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A smaller working memory means you can generalise your learning into new, creative combinations. You can get more inputs from the brain due to the memories being less tightly locked in. Your brain is used to being creative with the small amounts of memory it can work on at any period of time. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Potential</h2>
<p>You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.</p>
<p>Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts. </p>
<p><strong>Deliberate practice</strong> is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practising certain mental patterns deepens your mind.</p>
<p>The key to success is <strong>perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hard start - Jump to easy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start on the hardest problem first and move to easy one once you get stuck/lose momentum</li>
<li>Let diffuse mode work on the harder problem</li>
</ul></article>
