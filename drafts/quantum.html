<article><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this paper, an overview of quantum computers will be addressed;
fundamental quantum mechanical properties, recent advancements and
potential uses for the upcoming technology. I have focused on one recent
development of the qubit from a team of researchers at the University of
New South Wales (UNSW) who are using a phosphorus atom imbedded in a
chip of silicon-28 as the qubit. (Borghino, 2015)</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The digital age of computing has started to diverge. Traditional
computers are becoming much smaller; scientists are developing molecular
computers which are only 100s of nanometres wide. In addition to the
shrinking of technology, scientists are looking towards quantum
mechanics and its strange properties to create a new way of processing
information.</p>
<p>Traditionally classical computers store information in two states, 0 or
1. However, quantum computers store information as 0, 1 or as a state of
both 0 and 1. (Altepeter, 2010) This allows the potential for more
powerful computers with same amount of 'classical bits'.</p>
<h2>Recent advances in creating a qubit</h2>
<p>Qubits can be a multitude of things from the polarization of a photon,
the energy levels of an ion or the nuclear spin of an atom. (unknown,
n.d.) The most promising candidate has been utilised by a team of
researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). They are
harnessing the spin of an electron in a phosphorus atom. (Borghino,
2015)</p>
<h3>Electron spin</h3>
<p>The direction of an electrons spin state is caused by the interaction of
the electrons magnetic field and the external magnetic field applied to
it. When the electrons magnetic field aligns with the external magnetic
field the lowest energy state is achieved (spin down). To get it into
spin up, a pulse of microwaves are fired at the electron at a specific
frequency. In addition, if you stop the pulse at a specific time, the
electron will be in a superposed state of both up and down.</p>
<p>However, the property of the electron spin means that only discrete
values of an electron spin exists- namely spin up and spin down. This
means when the direction is measured, it will be in a classical state of
up or down. The choice using electron spin over other means is
highlighted below by the researchers at the UNSW.</p>
<p>"Silicon electron 'spins' also have very long 'coherence times': this
means data encoded on the spin can remain there for longer periods than
it would in most materials, before it is scrambled and lost. This is
important for performing successful calculations." (University of New
South Wales, 2015)</p>
<h3>Superposition</h3>
<p>The state of both 0 and 1 is a consequence of superposition. Sub-atomic
particles such as electrons and protons can exist in a superposition of
these two states (or wave of probability). (Mastin, 2009) It is helpful
to use mathematical notation shown to describe the phenomenon.</p>
<div class="math">$$\left. \ \mathbf{|\psi} \right\rangle\mathbf{= a}\left. \ \mathbf{|0} \right\rangle\mathbf{+}\left. \ \mathbf{b|1} \right\rangle$$</div>
<p>Where <strong><em>a</em></strong> and <strong><em>b</em></strong> are coefficients of finding the electron in
either <span class="math">\(\left. \ \mathbf{|0} \right\rangle\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(\left. \ \mathbf{|1} \right\rangle\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{\ }\left. \ \mathbf{|\psi} \right\rangle\)</span> is the qubit (wave
function).</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the wave function exists as the sum of possible
probabilities before being measured. As soon as the qubit is measured
the wave function collapses to one of the two states. (unknown, n.d.)</p>
<h3>Entanglement</h3>
<p>Two qubits have 4 quantum states, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{|0\rangle|0\rangle}\)</span><strong>,</strong>
<span class="math">\(\left| \mathbf{0} \right\rangle\left| \mathbf{1} \right\rangle\mathbf{+ \ |1\rangle|0\rangle}\)</span><strong>,</strong>
<span class="math">\(\left| \mathbf{0} \right\rangle\left| \mathbf{1} \right\rangle\mathbf{- |1\rangle|0\rangle}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{|1\rangle|1\rangle}\)</span><strong>.</strong> The second state listed known as
the singlet state has very peculiar properties; any measurement of one
half of the singlet state will give a completely random result. On the
other hand, when both qubits are measured, they result in opposite spin
direction- it seems as if the electrons seem to know about the others
state. (Mastin, 2009) They become entangled and described as one system
rather than two separate bodies.</p>
<p>This important property of the quantum world is known as entanglement. 2
entangled qubits provide 4 pieces of information- the probability of
finding the qubit in each of the 4 states. In comparison 2 classical
bits gives us 2 pieces of information- the state of each bit.
Consequently, the amount of information provided through qubits is
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{2}^{n}\)</span> classical bits. With only 300 qubits, all in an
entangled state of superposition, the number of 'classical' information
exceeds the amount of particles in the universe.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Since quantum computers exploit the parallelisms of quantum phenomena,
one major use of the technology would be to crack the RSA encryption.
Factorising large numbers that would take classical computers billions
of years could potentially be done in a few minutes. Furthermore, our
understanding of diseases would rapidly increase due to quantum
computers. (Freiberger, 2015)</p>
<h2>Overcoming problems</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, getting a fully functioning quantum computer has many
problems. A large amount of them stem from the qubit. The qubit needs to
be in an environment free of external factors which will cause
decoherence. Quantum computers are cooled to just above 0Â°K as thermal
energy at room temperature renders measuring electron spin completely.
Decoherence also occurs if the material surrounding the qubit has a
magnetic nucleus (Tyryshkin, 2011). Fortunately, the team at the
university of new south wales are using silicon-28 as it doesn't cause
decoherence. (Avaliani, 2002)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Scientists hope to improve qubit coherence time and create stronger
interactions with its environment. In 10 years' time, the team at UNSW
hope to create a quantum computer with 10+ qubits which is stable enough
to work at room temperature. However, we are still at the beginning of a
new approach to computing and data management. The future of quantum
computing is still in its infancy; the potential to harness quantum
phenomenon has yet to be fully understood.</p>
