<article><p>How do you manage your daily/weekly/monthly tasks and goals?</p>
<p>I want to speak about project management processes that I have started to use when working on solo tasks such as this blog post (and learning a new topic). One measure of a successful day is when I point to something I have created or finished. The size of the completed tasks vary. The tasks to be completed have to be related to a greater goal. How do I manage all this work?</p>
<p>The following tools and technique are used as and when necessary. In an ideal world, I would use them more often</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="daily to-do">A daily to-do list</a></li>
<li><a href="Kanban boards">Kanban boards</a></li>
<li><a href="/periodic reviews">periodic reviews</a></li>
<li><a href="#pomodoro">pomodoro</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>To-do Lists</h2>
<p>Daily to-do list are my most used task management tool and easiest to implement. Each evening I write 5 to 7 most important tasks I want to cover for the next day. And that is it. The size of the task should be small enough to be completed within no more than 2 hours. This forces me to break down larger problems into sub-tasks, which then could be tackled in a <a href="#pomodoro">pomodoro cycle</a>.</p>
<p>The size of the task also means I aim to complete all tasks within a day. During my degree, once each to-do task was completed and crossed off the list, I was free to do whatever for the rest of the day. This lead to reducing the number of tasks to 5, finishing early and feeling productive. I would sometimes have enough will to load 3 more tasks, effectively doing more than if I had 7 to start with. </p>
<p>The daily cadence also became important as it enforces a tighter feedback loop. With so much to do and learn, ...</p>
<p>I sometimes reduce the number of to-dos to 3 to 5, accounting for meetings, pairing sessions and slack (not the app but "unplanned time"). Daily to-dos are always written on paper. There is something satisfying about ticking a checkbox once the task is done. It is also the easiest way to get started. </p>
<h2>Periodic reviews</h2>
<p>This could be as small as planning the 3 to 5 tasks for the day ahead or monthly timelines. Managing goals and tasks across a range of time intervals work the best. The length of the reviews or retrospectives are proportional to the time frame they cover. Daily retrospectives can be fit in 25 minutes. Monthly retrospectives might take longer. </p>
<p>Currently I review the previous day and would like to review my weeks. I do have weekly one-to-ones which would benefit from preparing a reflection beforehand.</p>
<p>At work, each week we have an end of week retrospective on what went well, what didn't and what to improve for next week. We also have less frequent retrospectives that covers a wider time frame. How we can make next time better, ...</p>
<h2>Kanban boards</h2>
<p>I haven't found a mechanism that helps organize longer time frames than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">kanban boards</a>. A board consists of multiple columns representing collections of tasks in different states. The number of lists can be as granular as you want but three to four lists are enough: to-do, in-progress, backlog, and optionally, done. I use kanban boards to capture tasks that are will take more time than a few hours, or things I might want to investigate later. </p>
<p>There are a handful of software products that provide kanban boards. I use a GitHub project board under a repository containing notes to keep planning and work close to each other.</p>
<h2>Pomodoro</h2>
<p>The pomodoro technique is a time management structure in which work is broken into intervals. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>decide on a task to work on</li>
<li>set a timer for 25 minutes </li>
<li>work on the task</li>
<li>once the timer rings, take a 5 minute break </li>
</ol>
<p>The 25 minute work interval is defined as a pomodoro. After three pomodoros, a longer break is taken. Once the long break is finished another pomodoro can be started.</p>
<p>Pomodoro is useful in getting over the hurdle of getting started. 25 minutes is not a lot of time and, after the first or second pomodoro, tend to find it is better to skip the 5 minute break. The pomodoro technique is also useful at creating 25 minute sprints in which you focus for a short, fixed time. </p>
<p>Pomodoro aren't used as much as on most days, they aren't needed.</p>
<h2>Thinking behind tools.</h2>
<p>Tools should be easy to use. I try to stick to tools that are easy to get running. <em>Minimal</em> tools are good if you know what you want. The best tools are ones that can be used incrementally. You are able to be effective with the basic features. But, if you so choose, can reach out for something more powerful.</p>
<h2>Email, IM, calls, and tea</h2>
<p>Working remotely places a greater importance of asynchronous communication. By default I have my audio notifications turned off. At work, email is primarily used for external communication so I rarely have my email client open. I check emails at most twice a day, mostly for meeting invites. Slack, on the other hand, is the primary messaging app we use. To avoid distractions, I <em>try</em> not to read messages as they appear but leave the icon with a notification bubble. There is room for improvement here.</p>
<h2>Things I have tried?</h2>
<h4>Anki</h4>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a flashcard program that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> to help learn and memorize more efficiently. Anki is useful for memorizing and retaining information such as vocabulary for a foreign language, medical terms or memorable quotes. The downside to its effectiveness is that it is hard to follow without building a habit. Going a few days without reviewing cards can be derailing as the backlog of cards to review can become large and off-putting. I have yet to find a sustainable way of using Anki which can account for missing a few days. </p>
<h4>Getting things done</h4>
<p>I have heard it works well for people. I have never tried GTD despite reported success stories. One aversion to the method is its complexity.</p>
<h3>Things to Try.</h3>
<p>Time boxing.</p>
<p>Anti-todo lists, or writing down things you completed that were not planned throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Workflows are highly unique. What works for one person may be too much ceremony for another. The best tools and workflows are the ones that remove friction from you and the tasks that need to be be completed. What works for you? </p>
