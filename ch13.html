<h1> Chapter 13 </h1>

<div class=date>
</div>
<p>Dear Bond,</p>
<p>Well, I've found myself a little hideaway near the top of "The Hill" and I am
sitting cross-legged (yoga style) on a blanket and I am looking out over good
old Camp Boron and writing you this letter.</p>
<p>Did you pay attention to yesterday's lessons? Have you noticed how I have
already used, in this letter, many of the little ideas I talked about
yesterday? </p>
<p>You did notice? Good. Then I guess it's safe to go on.</p>
<p>But before I do (there's a baby rabbit about 7 yards from me!) I want to tell
you that I just talked to your mom and it put some pain in my brain. She works
hard and now that I am in here she more or less feels she's out there all alone
against the wolves.  Rick wants money. Chuck wants money. Your mom has bills
and I feel very pressured.</p>
<p>It hurts. </p>
<p>But you once said the smartest thing I've ever heard a kid say.  You said that
you were luckier than Jeff because when Jeff lived with me I was already rich
and that you get to be with me when I am not rich and, therefore, you get to
learn how I solve problems, especially money problems.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we can both learn something today. (NOTE: I say "well" almost as
often as Ronnie Reagan, don't I?) What I feel like doing is sniveling. I'd love
to take some drugs or alcohol and forget my problems. Or maybe just lie on my
bunk all day and read a book.</p>
<p>At the very least I'd like to eat. But I can't. I can't because this is my day
to fast. And to write to you. And to Z. And to work on a new ad for L. Etc.</p>
<p>And, so I shall. Not because (that bunny is still right here!) I want to but,
rather, because I <u>need</u> to. You see, when things are tough I have discovered
that a very very simple (but effective) thing to do is just keep moving in some
sort of positive direction.</p>
<p>And... and... let's talk about envelopes and little baggies filled with dirt.
O.K. as I recall, I was just about to tell you how to use a SRE to induce guilt
in a regular commercial DM sales pitch.</p>
<p>Here's how: What you do is write something like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and so, Mr. Jones, as you can see, what I am offering you is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a piece of a legalized Nevada whorehouse.
I hope you can take advantage of this offer.  But, if you can't, would you
please drop me a note and tell you can't participate at this time. That way
I'll feel free to make this exciting offer to someone else. I've enclosed a
self-addressed envelope and I have even put a stamp on it because (either way)
it is important that I hear from you right away.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please, please -- reply <strong>today</strong>!</p>
<p>Many lessons in that little block of copy. First of all, it's not just a guilt
inducer, it also develops a strong selling point: Namely, the selling point of
this being a genuine limited offer that some other lucky person will take
advantage of it you don't. And, the stamped envelope tends to "credential" that
point. (I just made a noise and my little bunny slipped away.) Here's something
else: If you can get a person who is <u>not</u> going to order to agree, in his mind,
to write and tell you he is not going to, then you will get more orders.</p>
<p>Can you guess why? Aha, you didn't get this one, did you, smart alec? No
matter. I'll tell you why. You see, what happens sometimes is that a person who
is getting a pen or pencil and a piece of paper in order to write you and tell
you "No" will sometimes start thinking like this: "Well, you jerk. I'd kind of
like to get in on this deal anyway and now that I've got the pen and paper I
may as well go ahead and order."</p>
<p>Now, let's switch our discussion to another kind of envelope
where you also pay the postage for your customer. I'm talking 
about, of course, the good old standby known as a BRE or
"Business Reply Envelope".</p>
<p>You've seen thousands of BRE's. They look like this:</p>
<hr>
<p>Rate<br>
Permit<br>
6666  </p>
<p>If Mailed In U.S. Postage Will Be Paid By<br>
</p>
<p>Nevada Inc.<br>
201 Anywhere Rd.<br>
Las Vegas, NV 20215   </p>
<hr>
<p>Most mailers love BRE's. They have the advantage of making it easy for the
customer to reply plus the advantage of being much cheaper than a stamped reply
envelope.</p>
<p>The reason they are cheaper is that you only pay the postage (and BRE fee) for
those envelopes that are actually mailed back to you. </p>
<p>However, they also have some disadvantages. Like these: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They slow up your mail. The post office has to tabulate how many BRE's you
get each day so they'll know how much you owe. This will hold up your mail (<u>and
your cash flow</u>!) for at least one extra day. Maybe more. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They telegraph that yours is not, in fact, a real personal letter. You know,
sooner or later, you've got to let your potential customers know that you want
him to buy something.  However, if you let him know immediately quite often he
won't even give you a hearing. And, in truth, this is a disservice to him.
Because, quite often, after he reads your info he will discover that what you
have to offer has genuine value to him. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So try to strategize your mailings so that he at least reads your letter <u>before</u>
he makes a decision. </p>
<ol>
<li>You can't do good guilt with a BRE. SRE's are much better for this purpose. </li>
</ol>
<p>And now, let's talk about yet another type of reply envelope. I call it the PSH
envelope. PSH stands for "Place Stamp Here".  They look like this:</p>
<hr>
<p>Nevada Inc.<br>
201 Anywhere Rd.<br>
Las Vegas, NV 20215  </p>
<hr>
<p>This is the most economical reply envelope of all. That's because (obviously)
the customer pays the postage. Let's talk about this envelope: First of all,
it's not as convenient for the customer so you will <u>lose</u> some orders because of
that. On the other hand, this envelope is more personal so you will <u>gain</u> some
orders because of that.</p>
<p><strong>(Guess what, Bondy? I think a solution to your mom's money problems just popped into my mind!)</strong></p>
<p>Now, of course, this envelope isn't as personal as an SRE but it is more than a
regular BRE. It is, as I have pointed out, cheaper than both.</p>
<p>What it is, then, is cheaper than a SRE and more personal than a BRE and, in my
judgment, this is the best envelope for most mailers to use. </p>
<p>More mailers should test PSH envelopes and carefully analyze the results. Many
of them are going to be surprised.</p>
<p>DAMN! I'm getting a little tired of writing about envelopes. I think I'll
switch over to discussing that little baggie filled with dirt.</p>
<p>However, my hour is up and I've got to go stand count. (They want to know where
I am all the time. They must like me!) </p>
<p>Tune in again tomorrow. </p>
<p>I Love You and Good Luck, </p>
<p>Dad </p>
