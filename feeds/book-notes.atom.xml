&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An apprenticeship is a season in your career when your focus is
more on your own growth than almost anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a time for you to delay your ambitions of immediately maximizing your earning potential in order to maximize your learning opportunities ... And once that season is over, your priorities will need to adapt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emptying the Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ironmag.com/archive/ironmag/2000_mg_reality_of_learning.htm"&gt;Michel Grandmont’s “Tasting a New Cup of
Tea.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your First Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become fluent in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; language for the next few years which will be used to solve problems and the default skill to hone when practising (Python).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best way to improve-- solve real problems (duh).
The fundamental way to improve this experience is to seek out opportunities to create &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; feedback loops (which help gauge progress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... test-driven development techniques can keep you focused on taking small steps and ensure you check your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The White Belt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've reached some competency but are at a plateau, how do you continue to accelerate the pace of learning and personal development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn new technologies, explore, try new paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now you must try to avoid synthesizing new and old knowledge until the new knowledge has had time to sink in, and approach this new knowledge with the mind of a beginner. This may mean losing some productivity in the short term in order take a leap forward once you master the new approach."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning new domains, you learn to express yourself &lt;em&gt;idiomatically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find something to &lt;em&gt;unlearn&lt;/em&gt;: write an existing program you have written in another language that uses a different paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unleash Your Enthusiasm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an apprentice you bring freshness and enthusiasm to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team dynamics should always be considered. If you find yourself on a team that does not accept your excitement, you will need to find ways to nurture your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a team that is open to excitement and contributions of an apprentice, this is the time to take risks and speak your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Concrete Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquire concrete skills so that others know you can take responsibility. Examples: writing build files in various popular languages, knowledge of various popular open source frameworks, basic web design, JS and standard libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expose Your Ignorance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceding to unspoken pressures and telling people what they want to hear is not a good way to build strong relationships. Tell people the truth. ... your reputation will be built upon your learning ability rather than what you already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to expose your ignorance is to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important traits that a craftsman can possess is the ability to learn, identifying an area of ignorance and working to reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down a list of five things you really don’t understand about your work. Put that list where others can see it. Then get in the habit of refreshing this list as your work changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confront Your Ignorance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick one skill, tool, or technique and actively fill the gaps in your knowledge about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an apprentice you must be able to &lt;em&gt;expose&lt;/em&gt; ignorance as well as confronting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deep End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get involved with bigger, larger projects and problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump in at the deep end. Take the promotion or foreign assignment even if there is a high chance of failure. Be prepared to fail and recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... you still need to remember that if the water level is above your head it means you’re drowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track the projects you work on in terms of size, complexity. Use it as a measure the progress of taking on responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retreat into Competence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dunning-Kruger, knowing that you know nothing in the vast scope of your field)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on &lt;em&gt;how much you do know&lt;/em&gt; and what you have learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforce what you do know via a small project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking the Long Road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Craft Over Art&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on delivering value to your customer over advancing your own self-interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustainable Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do what you love and the money will follow.” ... While many programmers could probably find higher-paying jobs in the short term, the money that follows from doing what you love will pay off handsomely in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down at least 15 things that motivate you. Wait a little while, then write down another five. How many of your motivations are about what other people think rather than what you feel?
Write down the list of five most important things and refer to it in tough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nurture Your Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Try to keep the sense of wonder about programming that you had at age 14. If you’re worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is." - pg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Draw Your Own Map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your role is not aligning with what you want to do day to day or there is no opportunity within the company to transition into increasing the work you enjoy, leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use Your Title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stay in the Trenches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Different Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accurate Self Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be the Worst&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room&lt;/em&gt;.
Surround yourself with excellent devs.
Being the weakest, your goal is to work harder than anyone else and work your way up from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find Mentors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rubbing Elbows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pair Programming, or broadly collaboration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sweep the Floor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new apprentice volunteer for the unglamorous but necessary tasks. Writing docs, editing wiki, tests, bug fixes, code reviews, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid becoming the team gopher that only does the unglamorous tasks or shying away from more responsibility. If that does happen, remember  to Nurture Your Passion, Unleash Your Enthusiasm, advocate for yourself, and look for every opportunity to prove yourself worthy of higher-level work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perpetual Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"software development is composed of two primary activities: learning and communication..." - Andy Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expand Your Bandwidth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must develop the discipline and techniques necessary to efficiently absorb new information, as well as to understand it, retain it, and apply it. Seek new knowledge and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practice, Practice, Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Deliberate Practice" (K. Anders Ericsson)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he masters described by George Leonard love to practice is that they do something a little bit different each time an exercise is performed. The point is not to hone your memory, but to discover the nuances in even the simplest skilled activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice makes permanent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the fundamentals sharpened!! Data structures and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breakable Toys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build small (useful) projects such as address book, wiki or calendar to learn and explore without the fear of failure. Actively try ideas and techniques that might lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal wiki is a good project to work with HTTP, REST, web design, full text search, databases...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples: Games (Tetris, tic-tac-toe), IRC clients, blogging software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to &lt;em&gt;learn new things&lt;/em&gt; (technologies, language idioms) and create a custom app that serves your needs. They should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use the Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the structure of the codebase and try to work out why the files were laid out that way. See if there is a rationale behind the way the developers modularized the codebase and compare it to the way you would have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick an algorithmically sophisticated open source project (mercurial?). Browse the source noting algorithms and data structures and design patterns that are new. Write a post describing the architecture and new ideas learnt. Where can it be applied in your everyday work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflect As You Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider whether your practices are novel, innovative, or outdated. Ask yourself questions about the things that the rest of your team takes for granted. If there is something particularly painful or pleasant about your current work, ask yourself how it got that way, and if things are negative, how can they be improved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Practices Map&lt;/em&gt;: Writing down things they do and connections between them. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Record What You Learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code diary :). 
Chronological record of lessons learnt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to make new connections every time you review the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and Private wikis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Share What You Learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write blog posts on lessons learnt. Provide the information you wish had existed and that would have helped you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Feedback Loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find something in your working environment that you can measure and, more importantly, affect. Track that metric for a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn How You Fail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he goal is to gain self-knowledge about the patterns, conditions, habits, and behaviours that lead you to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construct Your Curriculum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reading List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Read Constantly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study the Classics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dig Deeper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the primary sources of concepts (Roy Fielding's PhD thesis on REST)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out who first came up with the ideas and understand the problems they were trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read a tutorial, you should not be looking for code to copy but for a mental structure in which to place your new knowledge. Your goal should be to understand the historical context of the concept and whether it is a special instance of something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Y]ou need to take care not to accidentally become a narrow specialist. The goal is to be able to acquire as much specialized knowledge as necessary to solve any problem, without losing your perspective about the relative importance of different aspects of software development. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; (Come back to this later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Familiar Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know when to use the right tools. Trade-offs between the tools you know and productivity of the team. Don't let tools become "Golden hammers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge tools can become obsolete (subversion) and better tools are out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your career to prosper, you must learn to acquire and abandon familiar tools with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down a list of familiar tools. If the list has less than five items, look for tools that will fill gaps. Unfamiliar tools or new tools altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lists greater than five, are there more powerful tools available? Are there tools that may become obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Born to Run</title><link href="/born-to-run.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-05-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2021-05-19:/born-to-run.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Notes from Born to Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The best runner leaves no tracks"-- wasn't some gossamer koan, but real,
concrete, how-to, training advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our
two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we're scared, we run
when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket, ... Great Depression
..., Early 70s (Cold War), One year after the September 11 attacks,
trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when this ninety-five-year-old man came hiking twenty-five miles over the
mountain. Know why he could do it? Because no one ever told him he couldn't. No
one ever told him he oughta be off dying somewhere in an old age home. You live
up to your own expectations, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vigil had been furiously taking mental notes (Look how they point their toes
down, not up, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember? Back when you were a kid and you had to be yelled at to slow down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they'd never forgotten what it felt
like to love running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were so ignorant, they didn't even realize they were supposed to be burned
out, overtrained, and injured. Instead, they were fast; really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil Zatopek  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are two goddesses in your heart, ...  "The Goddess of Wisdom and the
Goddess of Wealth. Everyone thinks they need to get wealth first, and wisdom
will come. So they concern themselves with chasing money. But they have it
backwards. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all
your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous, and
follow you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My arms floated until my hands were rib-high; my stride chopped down to
pitty-pat steps; my back straightened so much I could almost hear the vertebrae
creaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think Easy, Light, Smooth, and Fast. You start with easy, because if that's all
you get, that's not so bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted on the wall of Vigil's office was a magic formula for fast running that,
as far as Deena could tell, had absolutely nothing to do with running: it was
stuff like "Practice abundance by giving back," and "Improve personal
relationships," and "Show integrity to your value system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ten minutes, Scott lay like a corpse. Then he got up and did it, shattering
the Badwater record with a time of 24:36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like every champion, he was up against the Curse of Ali:...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought if you could run one hundred miles, you'd be in this Zen state.
You'd be the fucking Buddha, bringing peace and a smile to the world. It didn't
work in my case--I'm the same old punk-ass as before--but there's always that
hope that it will turn you into the person you want to be, a better, more
peaceful person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Lieberman -- "A lot of foot and knee injuries that are currently
plaguing us are actually caused by people running with shoes that actually make
our feet weak, cause us to overpronate, give us knee problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a stroke of dark irony, Bowerman named it the Cortez--after the conquistador
who plundered the New World for gold and unleashed a horrific smallpox epidemic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The forward foot moves toward the track in a downward, backward, 'stroking'
motion (not punching or pounding) and the outer edge of the ball of the foot
makes first contact with the track," Wilt writes. "Running progression results
from these forces pushing behind the center of gravity of the body. ..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bowerman had an idea: maybe you could grab a little extra distance if you
stepped ahead of your center of gravity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We ran in canvas shoes," Lydiard went on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You don't stop running because you get old," said the Demon. "You
get old because you stop running."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whenever you run, remember that feeling of straining against the rope. It'll
keep your feet under your body, your hips driving straight ahead, and your
heels out of the picture."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the greatest marathoners in the world run like kindergartners. "Watch kids at
a playground running around. Their feet land right under them, and they push
back,"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1988, triathletes started to use aero bars on their bikes and cyclists mocked
them mercilessly--until Greg Lemond used one and won the Tour de France by eight
seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Quick, light leg
contractions are more economical than big, forceful ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It's like they're running on hot coals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to activate your fat-burning furnace is by staying below your
aerobic threshold--your hard-breathing point--during your endurance runs. (fact-check)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... his only advice being to focus on form and keep the pace relaxed enough to
occasionally breathe with my mouth shut. (Fifty years earlier, Arthur Lydiard
offered an equal but opposite tip for managing heart rate and pace: "Only go
as fast as you can while holding a conversation.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... tesgüino is very lightly fermented, so it's low in alcohol and high in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Man theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getting air may have determined the way we got our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bramble would later say. Running is just a controlled fall,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achilles tendon, which connects the calf to the heel: we've got
one, chimps don't ... Your butt's job is to prevent the momentum of your upper
body from flipping you onto your face. ...  Achilles tendon serves no purpose
at all in walking ... All an Achilles tendon does is stretch like a rubber band&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David put lizards on a treadmill, and found they can't even run and breathe at
the same time. The best they can manage is a quick scramble before
stopping to pant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how long would it take to actually run an animal to death? ... if you can
run six miles on a summer day then you, my friend, are a lethal weapon in the
animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... how old are you when you're back to running the same speed you did at
nineteen?"  ... It's sixty-four."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I was feeling so much stronger today than I had on the long haul
over from Batopilas, I realized, was because I was running like the Kalahari
Bushmen. I wasn't trying to overtake the antelope; I was just keeping it in
sight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Fooled by Randomness</title><link href="/fooled-by-randomness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-29T17:36:36+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T17:36:36+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-29:/fooled-by-randomness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; that which came with the help of luck could be taken away by luck

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;coup de foudre&lt;/em&gt;, a sudden intense infatuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero's trading style; extreme risk aversion, I love taking small losses, I just
need my winners to be large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero believes that risk-conscious hard work and discipline can lead someone to
achieve a comfortable life with high probability. Beyond that it is all
randomness; either by taking enormous risks, or by being extraordinarily lucky.
Mild success can be explainable by skills and labour. Wild success is
attributed to variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people prefer to make $70k when others around them are making $60k than
making $80k when others are making $90k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serotonin and Randomness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Your dentist is rich, very rich&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternative History.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of a decision cannot be judged based on its
outcome. (Judge decisions based on the costs of the alternative)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 million earned through Russian roulette does not have the same value as if
it were earned through artful practice of dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinction between the mind of a pure mathematician thriving on
abstraction and that of a scientist consumed by curiosity. A mathematician is
absorbed by what goes into his head while a scientist searches into what is
outside of himself. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behaviour not because they won or
lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can no longer visualize a realized outcome without referenced to the
nonrealized ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[History] affects the way I would wish to think by referencing past events, by
being able to better instead; the ideas of others and leverage them, correct
the mental defects that seem to block my ability to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesic patients shows signs of learning without being stored in conscious
memory &amp;mdash; Claparede pin handshake experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(non)Conscious/declarative memory&lt;/em&gt;. Much of the risk avoidance that comes form experiences is part of the
second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of
the information until that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the difference between noise and information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters but
how much is made is when it happens. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it
is the magnitude of the outcome that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popper&lt;/em&gt;, two types of theories: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theories known to be wrong and rejected (falsified)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theories that have not been falsified yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of knowledge and discovery is not so much in dealing with what we
know as in dealing with what we do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;em&gt;open society&lt;/em&gt; no permanent truth is held to exist; allowing for
counter-ideas to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use inductive methods and statistics to make aggressive bets, but I will
not use them to manage my risks and exposure. (?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have experienced leaps of joy over results that I knew was mere noise, and
bouts of unhappiness over results that did not carry the slightest degree of
statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of know &lt;em&gt;how we should behave&lt;/em&gt;. It is the execution that is the problem.
(Cigarette smoker)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting by convincing everyone that we
are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be
endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution bias&lt;/em&gt;: Attributing success to skill and failures to randomness.
80% think they are above the median in many things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start stressing personal elegance at your next misfortune, Exhibit &lt;em&gt;sapere
vivere&lt;/em&gt; (know how to live) in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress at your best on your execution day. The dignified attitude will make both
defeat and victory feel equally heroic. Try not to blame others of your fate,
even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit any self-pity. Do not complain. The
only article Lady Fortuna has no control over is your behaviour.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have a reader in mind when you write?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; No, you can't have that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; So it's quite unlike preaching?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Entirely. The two roles are completely unattached. When you are standing
in the pulpit, you must sound as though you know what you're talking about.
When you're writing, you're trying to find out something which you don't know.
The whole language of writing for me is finding out something you don't want to
know, what you don't want to find out. But something forces you to anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; For me it's like a journey, and the only thing you know that if when the
book is over, you are prepared to continue &amp;mdash; you haven't cheated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What would be cheating?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoiding. Lying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; An essay is not simpler, though it may seem so. An essay is essentially
an argument. The writer's point of view in an essay is always absolutely clear.
The writer is trying to make the readers see something, trying to convince them
of something. In a novel or a play you're trying to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; them something. The
risks, in any case, are exactly the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your first drafts like?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; They are overwritten. Most of the rewrite, then, is cleaning. Don't
describe it, show it. That's what I try to teach all young writers &amp;mdash;take
it out! Don't describe a purple sunset, make me see that it is purple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; As your experience about writing accrues, what would you say increases
with knowledge?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; You learn how little you know. It becomes much more difficult because
the hardest thing in the world is simplicity. And the most fearful thing, too.
It becomes more difficult because you have to strip yourself of all disguises,
some of which you didn't know you had. You want to write a sentence as clean as
a bone. That is the goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe is no longer a frame of reference, a standard-bearer, the classic
model for literature and for civilization. It's not the measuring stick. There
are other standards in the world. It's a fascinating time to be living. There's
a whole wide world which isn't now as it was when I was younger. When I was a
kid the world was white, for all intents and purposes, and now its struggling
to &lt;em&gt;remain&lt;/em&gt; white &amp;mdash;a very different thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I refuse to. Perhaps the turning point in one's life is realizing
that to be treated like a victim is not necessarily become one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you suggesting they are less concerned, somehow, with social
injustice?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no, you see, I don't want to make that kind of dichotomy. I'm not
asking that anybody get on picket lines or take positions. That is entirely a
private matter. What I'm saying has to do with the concept of the self, and the
nature of self-indulgence which seems to me to be terribly strangling, and so
limited it finally becomes sterile.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; You seem very troubled &amp;mdash;but not by death?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, true, but not at all by death. I'm troubled over getting my work
done and over all the things I've not earned. It's useless to be troubled by
death, because then, of course, you can't live at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you tell younger writers who come to you with the usual
desperate question: How do I become a writer?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Write. Find a way to keep alive and write. There is nothing else to say.
If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if
you're not going to be a writer nothing I can say that will help you. What you
really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is
real.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you discern talent within someone?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent
lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; How does it strike you that in many circles James Baldwin is known as a
prophetic writer?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't try to be prophetic, as I don't sit down to write literature. It
is simply this: a writer has to take all the risks of putting down what he
sees. No one can tell him about that. No one can control that reality. It
reminds me of something Pablo Picasso was supposed to have said to Gertrude
Stein while he was painting her portrait. Gertrude said, "I don't look like
that." And Picasso replied, "You will." And he was right.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Antifragile</title><link href="/antifragile.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-05-26:/antifragile.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Things that gain from disorder"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sword of Damocles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty is what wakes up the genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cato, Roman statesman, looked at comfort as a road to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcompensation, just a form of redundancy. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to be slightly inaudible, less clear. &amp;hellip; One should have enough
self-control to make the audience work hard to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucretius problem&lt;/strong&gt; the fool believes that the tallest mountain in the world
will be equal to the tallest one he has observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; you do not want to control your reputation, &amp;hellip; focus on altering
your exposure where you're impervious to reputational damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines, use it and lose it. Organisms, use it or lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistaking the absence of evidence for evidence of absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buridan's Donkey&lt;/strong&gt; A donkey equally famished and thirsty caught equally
between thirst and hunger will unavoidably die of either. He can be saved
thanks to a random nudge either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a name for the colour blue when you build a narrative, but not in
action &amp;mdash; the thinker lacking for a word "blue" is handicapped; not the
doer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iatrogenics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agency problem/principal agent problem&lt;/strong&gt;: The agent has personal interests
that are divorced from those of the one using his service (big pharma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make haste slowly, Lao Tsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination is our natural defense, naturalistic filter, I only write if I
feel like it and only on a subject I feel like writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use procrastination as a message from my inner self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturalistic fallacy&lt;/strong&gt; What is natural is not necessarily morally right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our track record in figuring out significant rate events in politics and
economics is not close to zero; it is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not if but when, safeguarding from negative black swans, smaller nuclear

&lt;p&gt;Antifragility in purest form, upside-downside asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca's barbell - Prefer to put 90/10 boring cash (protected against
inflation) / risky, maximally risky security cannot lose more than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A barbell can be any dual strategy composed of extremes; anything that removes
risk of ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insure for black swans, not small probable ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinecure cum writing is quite a soothing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I] find it preferable to work intensely for very short hours then do nothing
for the rest of the time until I recover completely &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximum weights, effortless long walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option is the agent of antifragility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is the ultimate option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility of life helps us to provide information to us about others, but also
about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party invitation - option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric in payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision maker focuses on the payoff, the consequences of the actions, the
Aristotelian focuses on right and wrong, raw logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baconian linear model: academia -&amp;gt; applied science &amp;amp; technology -&amp;gt; application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lecturing birds on how to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Suggests the opposite holds for most things, hackers, empirical tinkering.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epiphenomena&lt;/strong&gt;: Mental affects in the brain doesn't cause physical effects -
theory to application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People look for books that support their mental program, not people read books
then develop their ideas&amp;hellip;(?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Argues education does not lead to wealth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green lumber fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;:  Mistaking source of necessary knowledge for another,
less tractable, less narratable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference between narrative and practice &amp;mdash; important things that cannot
be easily narrated, lies in optionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionality is Promethean, narratives is Epimethean &amp;mdash; optionality vs
teleological table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinkering does not rely on narrative being true (Deep learning just &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; ?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet set up as military communication network - DARPA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicars and clergymen leaving recorded traces for prosperity than scientists,
(formally trained, wealthier?) - Bill Bryson &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Needham, Chinese science, top-down dictation, lack of European
tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bet on the jockey not the horse &amp;mdash; innovations drift, one needs
flaneur-like abilities to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff can be so large that you can not afford not to be in everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pin does not have a single maker but 25 persons involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannot centralize innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigid plans lead to option-blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antifragile: good news tends to be absent from past data (positive asymmetry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans were anti-theoretical pragmatic bunch, Arabs loved everything scientific
and philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions in captivity live longer; technically richer and guaranteed job security
for life, if these criteria you are focusing on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be bored with a specific book not the act of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; reading hours between thirty to sixty a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one could write essays with a rich, literary, but precise vocabulary and
maintain coherence, what one writes becomes secondary and the examiners get a
hint about ones style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonnerdy applied maths:find a problem, figure out maths that solves that
problem than studying in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe mistake in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat tony, never lets the other person frame the question, an answer is planted
in every  question; never respond with a straight answer that makes no sense to
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birth of tragedy, Apollonian vs Dionysian, yang without yin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditions provide an aggregation of filtered collective knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the payoff instead of the structure of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing decisions you made in the past week, you decided based on fragility not
probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of, we need better computation to predict black swans, modify your
exposure and learn to get out of trouble, traditional heuristics and religion
teaches us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size hurts you at times of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding uncertainty to projects causes them to take longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to lose a grandmother. (average temperature of 20 degrees)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More non linear, less important is the average, stability around average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statues are carved by subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelangelo was asked about the secret of his genius, &amp;hellip; particularly
how he carved the statue of David. &amp;hellip; It's simple. I just remove
everything that is not David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to pick carefully, I am as proud of the things we haven't done as the
things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bergson's Razor&lt;/strong&gt;: A philosopher should be known for one single idea, not
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindy Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Things that have stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; make them read the classics. The future is in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mental bias in overhyping technology comes from the fact we notice
change, not statics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; you lost 10,000  vs your portfolio was 785,000 and is now 775,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New things will lose their novelty, &lt;em&gt;treadmill effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy writing facing trees, and, if possible, wild untamed gardens with
ferns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Buildings Learn&lt;/em&gt;, Stewart Brand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was so much traffic in London because people wanted to be there, being
there exceeds the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining into dustbins all these
overhyped works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; student (who was studying economics)&amp;hellip; what to read? "As little
as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books that are not about
the last fifty years,"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original role of the prophet, to warn not to predict. And predict
calamities if people didn't listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something has been around for a very, very long time then irrational or not,
you can expect it to stick around much longer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extension of &lt;em&gt;via negativa&lt;/em&gt; and Fat Tony's &lt;em&gt;don't be a sucker&lt;/em&gt; rule,
non-natural needs to prove its benefits, not the natural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swelling Mother Nature gave me, not directly caused by the trauma but my
body's response to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the drugs available today, I can hardly find a &lt;em&gt;via positiva&lt;/em&gt; one that makes
a healthy person unconditionally "better".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; lobbying for reclassifications of conditions, and fine-tuning sales
tricks to get doctors to overprescribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the patient is near healthy, then Mother Nature should be the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; if the person is very ill, there are no iatrogenics to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something in nature you don't understand, odds are it makes sense
in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and
science do is flawed until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal
gratitude, &amp;hellip;, good bowel movements, no meeting rooms and periodic
surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in heuristics of religion and blindly accommodate its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cretans, &amp;hellip; they lived longer because of the types of food they consumed.
It could be true, but the second-order effect (the variations in intake) could
be dominant,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking effortlessly, &amp;hellip; as I speculate, is necessary for humans, perhaps
as necessary as sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live to improve on information, or improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche had the Latin pun, &lt;em&gt;aut liberi, aut libri&lt;/em&gt;, either children or books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For heroism is the exact inverse of the agency problem: someone bears the
disadvantage for the sake of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-person is not someone who does not have an opinion, just someone who
does not take risks for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;megalopsychon&lt;/em&gt;, a sense of grandeur that was superseded by the Christian value
of "humility". &amp;hellip; If you take risks and face your fate with dignity,
there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don't take risks,
there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take
risks, insults by half-men are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can't
feel insulted by a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hammurabi's code&lt;/strong&gt;: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and
causes the death of the owner, the builder shall be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People voting for war need to have at least one descendant (child or
grandchild) exposed to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; would do if he were
in your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How poetry can kill you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Humanity started] at the rank of an idle freeman, unpreoccupied with work. It
never meant &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; working; it just meant not deriving your personal and
emotional identity from your work, and viewing work as something optional, more
like a hobby. In a way your profession does not identify you so much as other
attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; if for the Greeks, only he who is free with his time is free with his
opinion, for our horizontal friend and advisor, only he who has courage is free
with his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way of checking if you are alive is by checking if you live
variations. Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren't for hunger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Notes"></category></entry></feed>
