&lt;p&gt;Tonight I am going to be writing about something I didn't think
I was going to be writing about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I am going to be writing about something I didn't think
I was going to be writing about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had a minor confrontation in the chow hall with a guy 
I've had a little trouble with before. He was giving out cups of 
ice and when I insisted on two cups he said 'no' and we verbally 
got into it. At one point, he suggested that if I didn't like
his refusal to give me more ice, we could go fight behind one of 
the dorms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glared at him and walked away. We were starting to attract 
attention and there were (always are) guards in the mess hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, this is no big deal except in a way, it is. This guy is
not very much like the room mate I had some trouble with. This 
guy is young, tattooed and stupid. He is a loser and I know from 
previous conversations with him that he is pretty much lost when 
he is on the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is always messing up, he smokes dope and he is in the 
Lieutenant's office often for disciplinary action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably kick the living \$#! out of this guy. You never 
know for sure, I could be wrong but he is not a big, bad type. 
Mostly, he is just plain stupid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what may be instructive in all this is why it happened and 
what I hope to do about it so I, hopefully, don't have to deal 
with it again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, let me explain that both the incident with my
roommate and this incident happened when I was "off". As a 
matter of fact, I am off right now and I have been off for more
than a week. When I am off, when anybody is off, this is 
communicated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, also, (or in conjunction with) being off, I am also 
quite vulnerable. I have fasted two days this week, I am missing 
L and I have been, in general, feeling sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No big deal. Except when you are in prison. When you are in
prison, even a very easy one like this one, your "Karma", I
believe, is extra important! It's important on the street too, 
but it is especially important here. This is a bad place to be 
weak, even a little and even momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I told you, you could sort of tell if you were off
by how close you could guess what time it is? Well, another
indicator is if you bump into things just a tiny bit or you are
just a tiny bit clumsy. Don't forget HALT. Hungry. Angry.
Lonely. Tired. When I went into that mess hall, I was all of 
this except angry and I was probably a little angry too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's an interesting thing about both of these two 
incidents. In both cases, I was "wrong". Not big deal wrong. But 
wrong from a not being aware and on top of things aspect. You
see, in the incident with my roommate, if I had been aware, I
would have realized that my radio was causing an infuriating 
disturbance. And, in this recent incident in the mess hall, I
should have realized that this guy was deliberately positioned 
there for the express purpose of rationing out the ice and here
I was responding to his "What about the rest of the guys?" with
the answer, "To hell with the rest of the guys!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, believe it or not, I said that a little unconsciously 
because I sort of thought he was joking. You see, I just wasn't
on top of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the street, neither of these things would have been a big 
deal. But here, there is a lot less slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that I know I'm off, what do I do? Well, I certainly 
don't intend to fight this guy who I refer to as "The Rodent". 
That could cost me six months extra in the joint. But, I don't 
want many more of these incidents either. So, what I intend to 
do is lay low for a while until I am feeling strong and not
feeling vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know why I'm going to lay low? It's because I'm concerned. 
Not physically scared ("The Rodent" isn't very threatening) but
concerned that I better get back on top mentally to be more
prepared to deal with this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it seem like I'm making a big deal out of all this? Don't 
kid yourself. It's serious. I'm missing L like crazy right now,
I am missing my freedom, I am angry about having to be here, I 
am diminished by my previous confrontation, I am weak from 
fasting, I am tired (albeit pleasantly) from my long run and all 
the time I spend in the sun and, in general, I am a bit
weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No good. Not here. So, what I intend to do is fall back and
regroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, for a little while, gong to try to avoid (as far as
possible) my fellow inmates. I'm going to fast tomorrow and sort 
of hid out. I don't intend to fast again after that for another
week. You know, when I'm on the street (God, I even talk like a
con now!) I also avoid people whenever I fast and it is even 
more important here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first I'm going to lay low and secondly, I am going to try 
not to "emerge" until I have pumped a little iron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I may be wrong but, I think had I been "pumped"
neither of these incidents would have happened. I think this for 
two reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I would have been more alert and never did the things that
perpetuated these incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) And secondly, when I am "pumped" and on top of things, people 
react differently to me because I send out different "vibes".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, another way I can tell I am stressed right now is my 
vision is a little blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, after all this preamble can I relate any of this to your 
success at DM and MO? You bet. At the time in my life when I was 
making the most money, I followed the same procedure I am
talking about here. Namely: I pay attention to myself and when I 
am off, I drop out of sight and do what is necessary to
strengthen myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important here, it is important out there, and it is 
especially important in business dealings. People can smell it 
when you are weak. When you are vulnerable. They can smell 
success too. They can sniff out a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can't fake it. Not for long. You've got to be it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord I'm tired. My vision is more blurred. And, I have just made 
some minor but maybe important changes in my planned routine 
over the next little piece of time. I'll tell you what they are
when I resume writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have decided is, I had better not take a day off running
right now. I intend to run in the morning and fast tomorrow. 
And, then, run again Sunday, even though I fasted the day
before. What I'll do I think, is I'll get up early like (sun up) 
5AM and eat a couple oranges and drink a little coffee and maybe 
take warm up shower or a longer than normal warm up walk and 
then run Sunday too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy, did I just have a good talk! I found a guy here who is very 
much like me. His life is stones, he's intelligent, he's 
Cherokee Indian and he has had some "incidents" also and he gave 
me some good advice. He said you can't sink to their level. Just 
don't talk to them. He also said avoid cursing. And, it's funny; 
he does the same stuff I do: He runs, he pumps iron, etc. Maybe
a valuable friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired. I really want to get out of here now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is the last of my first batch of letters (this is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;25) to you, I am going to try and think of something extra,&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe a little special to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what. Let's see. How about this? One of the things
I have learned here is how precious the good times and the good
people are. I hope I have learned never again to not take fare 
of my special relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the one I have with you. Let's remember we've got something 
very special and really take care of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  I've got four more minutes to do to get my hour in. Let's
see. I guess what I want to focus on here at the end is my 
resolve to "go underground" and quietly strengthen myself. I've
really got to do it. I've got to transcend myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, what I think my theme will be is to make a game of
becoming an expert at quietly diffusing explosive situations and 
sending out stronger vibes so I have fewer (or maybe none) 
encounters to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's It! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 24</title><link href="/chapter-24.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-07-05T07:15:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-07-05T07:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-07-05:/chapter-24.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Son,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm feeling better today. I think these short, frequent
days of fasting are really cleaning me out. I really feel a need 
now, more than ever, to shed my excess weight because it is
starting to get really hot here. In fact, I'll be it's 80

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm feeling better today. I think these short, frequent
days of fasting are really cleaning me out. I really feel a need 
now, more than ever, to shed my excess weight because it is
starting to get really hot here. In fact, I'll be it's 80
degrees or so already this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow. What I want to tell you this morning is that after 
tomorrow I am going to stop writing these letters for a while. 
There are several reasons: For example, I need to review some
reference material and take notes and then, more or less 
outline, the future letters as my babblings seem to me to be 
getting too random. Another thing is that I want you to get this 
first batch of 25 letters typed up so I can easily review them 
and take notes from them also. And, also, I need to catch up on
some of my other work like filing my rule 35 motion (a request 
for a modification of sentence) so I'll have a chance of getting 
out of here earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, I have a couple of "bankers" who are eager for me
to develop some promotions which they will finance and then we 
will split any profits 50/50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? I think an excellent way for you to learn how 
to make money in this business is to watch over my shoulder as I 
begin to create one profitable promotion after another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I'm going to start: First of all, I am going to go
through the SRDS book and make a note of all the lists that look 
like hot markets. Then, I'm going to show Eric this list of
lists and ask for his comments. I'm sure he will be able to add
to my lists and maybe he will also be able to tell me that some
of the lists are really not so hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, after all that, I will have a page full of list 
selections and I will write you a letter telling you what lists
I have selected. After that, I will put on my thinking cap and 
develop some product ideas to try and sell to the various lists. 
By the way, I would very much appreciate any ideas that pop into 
your head after you see my list of lists. Well, in any case, 
after all this, I will sleep on it and then, pretty soon, I will 
codify (isn't that a neat word) and isolate the projects I want
to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I'll talk to my bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the way it works with my bankers. If they see a project 
they would like to be involved with, they will have to come up 
with a development fee of $5,000.00. (Believe me, that's peanuts 
to these guys.) This $5,000.00 will be used to create a DM piece 
and to make a test mailing of that piece to 2-5M names. We will
also use some of the money for product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K. after that, if the response is no good, the banker will eat 
his $5,000.00 loss and we will go on to the next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, the results look good, we will then proceed to a
larger mailing of perhaps 50,000 pieces. And then, after we get
our results from the 50,000 pieces, if everything still looks
good, we will start rolling out and taking care of business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good outline, I think. I intend to keep you informed
every step of the way and I'll let you "live" the development of 
these projects with me. And, as a matter of fact, I think I will 
let you help me with some of these projects and give you a small 
cut of the action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sharpen your driving skills. Do your roadwork and get
cracking on all those other things I told you were good things 
to do. I'll join you again on my lunch hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kiddo, it's past the lunch hour but better late than 
never, eh? Whatever. I'm stuck for a theme again. What do you
suggest? O.K. How about the subject of IMPACT? Good, I'm glad
you agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact is the impression you or your promotion makes on its
intended target. Someone once said that the average American is
subjected to about 1,500 commercial messages every day. Probably 
so. Especially when you count billboards, ads on TV, ads on
radio, ads on the backs of buses, on taxicabs, on match covers,
in newspapers, magazines, direct mail pieces, etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, out of all those ads very very few have any appreciable 
impact. And impact is one of the things I strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, what I want to talk about right now is my favorite way in 
all the world to achieve impact with my DM promotions. What I'm
talking about is attaching things to the top of my letters. I've 
mentioned this before but now I want to go into it in
considerably more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best letter ever to use this technique was the classic 
"dollar bill" letter featured in "The Robert Collier Letter
Book." (must reread) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a first class letter that was designed to raise funds 
for a children's hospital. When the recipient opened the 
envelope he discovered a personal typed letter with a real 
honest-to-goodness dollar bill attached to it. The copy
explained that the writer wanted to donate a thousand dollars to 
a certain children's hospital but that he realized that a
thousand dollars wouldn't go very far. So, what he (the writer)
had decided to do was divide his $1,000.00 contribution into 
1,000 - one dollar bills and then mail these bills to 1,000
different people. Now, he went on to say, what he hoped is that
everybody who received one of these dollar bills would decide
not to keep it and, instead, send it straight to the hospital
with one or more dollars of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it work? Oh my! It was probably the most effective direct
mail promotion ever mailed. It got better than a 90% response
and the people to whom it was mailed eventually contributed tens 
of millions of dollars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's Impact! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in the mail, I received a copy of my Japanese "Penny" 
promotion. This promotion, as you know, has a Japanese "Penny" 
attached to the top of the letter and the copy says that the 
writer is attaching the penny to the letter for two important
reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason is to get attention. And, secondly, because 
what the letter has to talk about was discovered in Japan, the 
writer felt that some sort of "Japanese" eyecatcher was
appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter is working like crazy. It has impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, be careful. Whatever you attach to the top of your letters
should tie in with the rest of your letter and what you are
selling. It should make sense and fit into the promotion in a
natural way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how not to use impact: Some companies
print up advertising that, at first glance, looks like a traffic 
ticket. Then, they hire kids to put these traffic ticket type
ads on the windshields of parked cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens is, that the owner of the car comes back to 
discover what seems to be a traffic ticket on his windshield and 
he, naturally, grabs it forthwith and starts to read it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sure gets his attention. It sure achieves impact. The guy 
will sure remember that company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But He Will Remember The &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company With Distaste! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He Will Remember That This &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is A Company That Scared &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him And Made Him Angry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what all that adds up to? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Sale! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: You must not use "cheap tricks". Make what 
you attach to the letter "fit in". All it takes is a little
imagination. Let's see if I can come up with a couple of 
original examples: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about attaching an eagle feather to a letter that tells how
these birds are in danger of becoming extinct? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about attaching a Mexican Peso to a letter that talks about
inflation? I did it and it was a great puller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a computer microchip attached to a letter that 
explains why a certain new electronic product is superior to the 
competition? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about my son attaching a picture of himself to a letter to 
his old man that tells him how he is getting into good shape?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about you send me some ideas along these lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 23</title><link href="/chapter-23.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-07-04T16:24:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-07-04T16:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-07-04:/chapter-23.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am in my room trying to avoid the heat. I heard it
is 114 degrees outside right here and 120 in Palm Springs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. We must press on. I am fasting today and I did a 
little bit of roadwork (just walking) a bit earlier …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am in my room trying to avoid the heat. I heard it
is 114 degrees outside right here and 120 in Palm Springs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. We must press on. I am fasting today and I did a 
little bit of roadwork (just walking) a bit earlier when it
wasn't so hot. I also finished doing some changes in an ad for 
L. and I am working on a DM letter for him. In addition, I wrote 
and mailed a letter to Joanie and I am writing this letter to
you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason for telling all this and the reason is I want
to give you some guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm serious. I was a little disappointed during our last visit 
when you told me you haven't been doing your roadwork. Now, of 
course, if you have been sick that's one thing but, if you are 
goofing off just because you "feel bad" that's quite another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen up, Bondy: These letters are a labor of love for me and I 
am trying to reach you all the important stuff I know. And, one
of the most important things I can teach you is to just do it! 
KEEP ON PEEPING ON! Everybody else here has been eating steaks 
and "celebrating" the 4th. That's OK but, right now, I've got
more important things to do and those are: (1) get my body in
shape (2) educate my youngest son (3) make a lot of money and
(4) keep up my important relationships on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm doing it all. I am heartsick for my woman, I am living 
in 114 degree heat I have jerks for roommates, and, above all I
AM IN PRISON!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I'm still doing it. So, you do it too. You are made out of
the same stuff I am and I am so proud of you, you wouldn't 
believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But get this. It doesn't matter how much you learn if you don't
use what you learn. So when I tell you to do your roadwork and 
exercise with weights and study and read ads aloud and write 
them out in your own handwriting, I mean for you to do it and do 
it now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don't mess around with your life. I have messed up enough for 
both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of sermon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm going to talk to you about a big difference between 
people who make it in any field (including crime) and those who
do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That difference is awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people (at least many) walk around with their heads in the
sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are lost in a fog. They go whichever way the current of the 
streams of their world happens to push them. They are sheep and
they are regularly shorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bad way to be in prison. Prison is a microcosm of
society and weak fish are gobbled up fast. So are those who walk 
around with their heads in the clouds oblivious to what is going 
on about them. You can't sulk in prison. You can't waste time
feeling sorry for yourself. You can't stay lost in fantasies 
about your woman or what you are going to do when you hit the
streets. No. What you must be here (and it's a good idea 
wherever you are!) is alert, on top of things and ready at any 
time to "catch a break". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guys in prison take care of themselves. They exercise their
bodies, pay attention to their grooming, read, study and much
more. You see, you never know when opportunity will knock (and 
it does, even here) and, if you are smart, you must be ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does all this have anything to do with direct mail and mail
order? You bet it does. Mail order (and all other) fortunes are
made by men and women who know what's going on in their fields.
These are the people who stay up to date. They read the trade
journals, they make sure they are on everybody else's mailing
list so they know what the competition is doing, they read all 
the "HOT" mail order publications, they keep their "SWIPE FILE"
up to date, they read and reread the classic books written by
the best people in the field, they have idea files that contain
newspaper articles, notes of unusual info, hot new ideas, good 
layouts, unusual propositions, and so forth. They also know who
the leaders are in their respective fields and they communicate
with these people on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, kiddo, quite often I am referred to as an advertising
genius, the "best copywriter in the world" and so forth. Now, as 
you know, I would be the 1st person in the world to deny these 
claims but if I really am so good, there is at lest one reason 
for it that everybody misses. It is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Work Like Crazy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came back from the TV area and there is a guy out there 
who lives across the hall from me. At first, I didn't recognize
him. He's a white guy, a body builder, and he has long flowing 
shoulder-length hair. He's been down for a long time and the 
reason I had a hard time recognizing him is his hair is now very 
short and neat. And, I'm telling you, with his short, neat hair
and his no-nonsense glasses, he looks like Clark Kent. Well, 
anyway, I heard him explaining to another inmate that he is
getting ready to go before the parole board and he is going to 
make sure he doesn't give them any reason to not turn him loose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, my man, is the attitude to have. Always be ready to catch
a break. You know, if you play enough poker, sooner or later,
after thousands of hands, everybody in the game will more or 
less have been dealt the same amount of good hands, bad hands
and mediocre hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determines the winners? It's how they play the cards that 
were dealt them. Were they alert and ready to exploit the good 
ones? Did they perceive that the bad ones were in fact bad in
time enough to dump them without huge losses? Were they ready to 
exploit or abandon their mediocre hands as the different 
situations dictated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweat the details. It's an area I have been remiss in and I am 
working to correct this state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do it too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, am I doing a lot of writing! I've even learned to hold the
pen another way when my hand gets tired from holding it the
regular way~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops! I lost it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? It's so hot in this room I have to keep a 
bandanna (it's the blue one) under my arm to keep from getting 
sweat stains on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, we're going to talk about believability. Believability
is one of the top most important ingredients of good MO &amp;amp; DM 
promotions. One way to increase believability is to give exact 
details. Instead of "most car owners" write "77.6% of all car
owners". Instead of "you can lose lots of weight" write "and the 
average reported weight loss over a 31-day period was 37.5 
pounds for men and 26.3 pounds for women". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, did you notice up there that when I mentioned my bandanna,
I said "it's the blue one" in parenthesis? Did you wonder why I
wrote it like that? I bet you didn't. I hope not. I hope not 
because if you did notice, then you were noticing my writing 
style instead of my message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's not good. However, I'll bet that little extra detail
of info drew you closer to me and my letter and made this
communication "more real" for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you were a stranger, these types of details makes
everything that is written that much more believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's something else that seems to fit in my rather mish 
mash theme for today. It has to do with time. You know 
something? Most people who are on top of things and "aware"
usually know what time it is within a few minutes without
looking at a clock or watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check yourself right now. Don't look up from this page and write 
down right here what time you think it is. {time you think it is 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;___} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now check and see what time it actually is and write it down 
right here. {time it actually is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;___}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much difference is there? If there is more than 10 minutes,
you are off too much. You should be able to guess with no more 
than a 7-minute margin of error either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the ways I check myself. And, if I am more than 
7-minutes off, I take a walk or do something else physical 
before I have any important discussions or make any important
decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what got me going on about this? Of course you don't. 
Well, what got me going was, I looked at my watch and realized I 
was a full hour off! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Buddy, here we go again. That section on propositions and 
an "excuse for a deal" was quite interesting, wasn't it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Buddy, here we go again. That section on propositions and 
an "excuse for a deal" was quite interesting, wasn't it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I think my letters are getting a little bit random but 
that's O.K. I sort of think it's good to write about what pops 
into my mind, at least for right now, and then maybe we can
review all these letters later and make something out of them
that's more cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, today I'm going to start by telling you about a 
little trick that will improve your copywriting. And that little 
trick is to read your copy out loud. What happens when you read
your copy out loud is that you will verbally stumble over all
the places that are not smooth. Then, of course, what you do, is 
rewrite the rough spots and read the copy out loud again. And, 
what you do, is you keep repeating this process till your copy 
is completely smooth and you can read it without stumbling at
all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, advertising writing needs to be the best writing of 
all. It needs to flow from start to finish without a bump or a 
bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, do you remember how I told you to write out in your own 
handwriting good ads and DM pieces written by other people? You
do remember? Good. Well, what I want to tell you here is that
you should also read those same ads and DM pieces out loud. You
see, by doing this writing and reading aloud of good material
you will find that the process of writing good ads will be 
internally imprinted on your nerves, muscle fibers, brain cells
and every fiber of your being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the message is clear: Get yourself a collection of good ads
and DM pieces and read them aloud and copy them in your own
handwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now what? Here I am stuck again. But not for long. What
happened during my last break is I put together a deal and I 
think maybe it would be a good idea at this point to talk a
little about the business of mail order. Here's how some of my 
deals work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am doing is going through the SRDS list book and looking
for mailing lists that I think will yield a good profit if 
exploited properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K., after I have identified the list I want to go after I then 
start thinking about a product to sell to that list. By the way, 
I am especially interested in selling paper and ink and, 
specifically, written reports that solve a problem for the 
people on the mailing list. Here are some tentative titles of
reports that will give you an idea of what I mean: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How To Raise Your Child's I.Q. Before It Is Even Born!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(for expectant mothers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How To Fix Your Car To Get 50% More Miles Per Gallon!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(for owners of gas guzzlers) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How To Collect From Social Security At Any Age!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I already did this one and made $800,000.00 from it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. Well, after I have identified the list and come up
with the idea for the product, I then discuss this project with
one of my bankers. If he likes the project (and they nearly
always do) what they do is they put up roughly about $5,000.00 
to get everything going. This five thousand is used to develop 
the report I want to sell, to rent the test names, to pay all
costs of the test, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what happens is I create the DM promotion and have Blade
put it into the mail. Now then, one of three things will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a decided loser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a decided winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is a decided loser my "banker" will have lost his
$5,000.00. If it is a decided winner my banker will then put up
perhaps another $50,000 and we will mail approximately 100,000 
pieces to get the ball rolling. Then, after that, we will
finance the rest of the mailing from our cash flow and my banker 
and I will split the profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very clean. Very neat. Very straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it's marginal? Well, in that case we will discuss the
project again and make a judgment as to whether or not it makes
sense to risk another $5,000 for another test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. That's the way it works and it's a nice simple way of
doing business. Well, Bondy, I'm going to stop for now. I am 
having a pretty sad day. Don't worry though, I'm O.K., just a
little heartsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am at the top of the hill in the library and once again 
I'm stuck for a subject. I think a lot of it is because I have 
{word deleted} on my mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it seems to me that I feel like outlining the steps 
to direct mail success so that's what I'm going to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 - Find a hot market (mailing list)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 - Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) to
sell to that market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3 - Create a direct mail promotion that describes the 
product (or service) and the benefits of owning the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 - Make a test mailing (1,000 to 5,000 pieces) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5 - Analyze results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6 - If results are good, mail 20,000 to 100,000 more
letters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 7 - If results are still good, start rolling out and taking 
care of business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it's really a simple procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use good common sense, your chances of success are
excellent. Where people go wrong is by making it too 
complicated. Actually, this is only one of the ways people go
wrong and it occurs to me that it would be helpful to enumerate
the most common reasons for MO &amp;amp; DM failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, toward this end I'm going to tell you about a little
discussion I had just a couple hours ago. What happened is I was 
settling down writing an earlier portion of this letter when a 
friend of mine told me he wanted to chat with me in private. 
(Chat! Isn't that nifty word to describe a prison conversation?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what he wanted to talk about was that a friend of his
had invented a gizmo that lets you make stuff out of wood the
same way a key-making machine lets you make keys out of blank
metal. (Actually, I don't fully understand what this thing does, 
but no matter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, he wants me to take a look at the papers on this
thing and see if I think it is worth promoting because the guy 
who invented this thing isn't following through with it because
he can make so much more money smuggling dope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all things! Oh my! Well, what I told him is I would be glad 
to help. However, I also told him that he was making the single
most common mistake made by people who want to break into the MO 
business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is that mistake? The mistake is finding or developing a 
product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This
is backasswards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You Must Always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find A Market First... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Then Concentrate On A Product! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products are a dime a dozen. They are important but much less
crucial to success than finding a hot market. I'll tell you
this: A guy with a new product cannot always find a hot market 
for that product but a guy who has uncovered a HOT MARKET can
always find a product to fill the needs of that market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am again sitting down to write and not knowing what I am
going to write about. Yesterday was the hardest day I've had 
here so far. Nothing special happened, it's just that I started
really longing for my freedom. Today my road work was so hard
that I had to divide it up into three sections and run both in 
the morning and again between 10:30 and 11:30 in order to be 
able to finish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm tired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, kids in Africa are starving so let's get started. I 
still am stuck to let's see. Hmn? Maybe it's time we talked
about propositions. Propositions are very important. They are
the "deal" you are offering. For example: One deal might be that 
if you buy one item you get another item free. Another example 
of a proposition is the one used by the record and book clubs. 
It goes like this: "You can have any 10 records you want right 
now for only 99Â¢ if you agree to buy an additional record every 
other month for the next two years." Another very common "deal"
or proposition is: "If you buy right away you will get a big 
discount." And another is: "I'll give you a discount if you buy
more than one." And, of course, the most common proposition of 
all is simply: "If you give me X dollars I will give you X 
product!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propositions are very important in DM and MO selling and a very
important ingredient in making your propositions work is the 
"reason why". In other words when you say in effect, "Have I got 
a deal for you!" you need an explanation as to why you are 
offering this good deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, if you don't have an explanation, your "deal" won't be
believable and you may not get the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some common explanations for good deals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm going out of business." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I just had a fire and I'm having a fire sale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm crazy." (all used car dealers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I owe taxes and I've got to raise money fast to pay them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've lost my lease and I've got to sell this merchandise
right away before it gets thrown into the sheet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've got to make space for some new merchandise that is 
arriving soon so I will sell you what I have on hand real
cheap."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. All of these explanations work and that's why they
are used all the time. However, there is a far more compelling 
"excuse for a deal" and if you can find a way to use it you can
dramatically increase your sales volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? I just thought of something else you can do to
make your copy more effective so I am going to take a detour 
here and tell you about it before I forget. Don't worry. We'll 
come back to propositions in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a couple paragraphs back I wrote: "and if you can find a 
way to use it, you can dramatically increase your sales volume." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, compare that to this: "and if you can find a way to use it, 
you can make yourself a bushel of money!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't that a lot more powerful? You bet! The words "dramatically 
increase your sales volume" do not even begin to conjure up the
visual imagery of "a bushel of money." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, write like that. Bring your story down to earth and hit 'em
where they live. (In their hearts and their pocketbooks!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Bondo, I just came up from my visit with you and Eric and
it sure was good to see both of you. You know, a lot of people 
believe it would be better for all concerned if I never had a
relationship with {name deleted} again. And, they may very well
be right. But I can't help it; I love her and I miss her like
crazy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as you probably know, Eric told me she's seeing another guy 
now. I can't blame her. We are broken up and I always told her 
anyway that I didn't want her to wait around for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But boy it sure hurts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, once again, I'm writing about it because it releases me a 
little bit. You know, kiddo, you can't always control what 
happens to you in life but you do have a lot of control over 
your responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I do to deal with this hurt? I write. I do my road
work. I do my chores. I don't snivel. And mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Just Keep On &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keepin' On &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? I mean, unless you're going to take the pipe there
really is no other rational choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we'll talk about that extraordinarily effective excuse 
for a deal. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Am Offering You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Deal Because You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By Virtue Of Some Unique Circumstance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are So Special &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bears a little explanation. Listen to this: Once upon a 
time I wrote a letter to sell a family crest wall plaque. This 
letter contained a photograph of the wall plaque just like I 
have talked about doing and what that letter told my reader was
something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. So and So, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you would like to see what the So and So family 
 crest looks like in full color so I am sending you the
 enclosed wall plaque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we have the So &amp;amp; So wall plaque in stock is
 because we needed to take some pictures of our products for 
 publicity purposes and So &amp;amp; So is one of the family crests
 we used when making our samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now that we are finished with our PR campaign we 
 have this plaque in stock with your family crest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, since we can't sell this wall plaque to anybody unless 
 they are named So &amp;amp; So we have a very limited (as you know, 
 there aren't many So &amp;amp; So's) market for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, therefore, since your name is So &amp;amp; So we'd like to 
 offer it to you at a true and honest discount of X percent! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did this approach work? Wow! Did it ever! Like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 Million In Sales! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I'm sad and it's hard right now to keep on keepin' on
but that's what I'm going to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, as you can see, in that last example I found a way to
show my customers that he was unique and valuable to me. Now,
let's see if we can come up with some other ideas along this 
line: For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm offering you this special deal because your trade in is a 
1976 Gas Sucker and I have a customer who wants that car.
Therefore, I'm willing to break even on the sale to you make my
profit from the other guy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since you are one of the world's leading gynecologists we feel
you are in a unique position to appreciate this picture book of
unusual______" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since you have proven yourself to be an astute judge of art, we 
are willing to send you these paintings at half price but only 
if you will give us your opinion in writing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A mutual friend of ours, Tom Smith, said I should write you 
because, he says, you are the best judge of value of a book like 
this that he knows." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward. Onward. Onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hurting and the radio is playing "Amazing Grace" by, I 
think, Linda Ronstat. Damn! Life gets tough sometimes! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's more. How about this opening: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. So &amp;amp; So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached a dollar bill to the top of this letter for two
reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I needed some way to get your attention because,
secondly, I have a very important message for you and every
other real estate agent in L.A. County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. So &amp;amp; So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know there are only 117 So &amp;amp; So families in the entire 
U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true. And, because you are one of them, blah, blah,
etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long, long time ago Dennis Haslinger told me that most of the most serious
mistakes I would make in life would be bad ego decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that to be true. I have made quite a few bad ego decisions with
women, many, many bad ones …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long, long time ago Dennis Haslinger told me that most of the most serious
mistakes I would make in life would be bad ego decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that to be true. I have made quite a few bad ego decisions with
women, many, many bad ones with money and quite a few that put me in some sort
of physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to avoid such a mistake right now and I am hoping that maybe
writing to you about it will help. What happened is that yesterday I was
playing my radio through my headphones and I was playing it so loud that all
that KMET rock and roll was irritating my roommates. In all truth, I was wrong
in doing this and I have done it once before and one of my roommates (the first
time) had to politely ask me to turn it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I was laying there completely lost in all this rock and roll I became
aware of someone screaming my name and when I cut the radio off I could hear
one of my other roommates screaming at me and telling me to show some
consideration for everybody else and not to give him any "back" talk or he
would break the damn thing (my radio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, how about that? It got very quiet in the room and he turned away from me
and I remained silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shook me up some. Not an enormous amount but some. All kinds of things ran
through my head. I wanted to explain to him that I was sorry and didn't realize
I was disturbing everybody and, also I wanted to run a "macho trip" on him and
tell him if he kept running his mouth I was going to rip off his head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I also thought of simply explaining to him that a better way to handle a
situation like this would have been to simply tell me the volume was too loud
and then I would have voluntarily turned it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn't do any of those things. What I did instead, as I said, is I
remained silent eating a little humble pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Bondy, I think I made a good decision. But I'll tell you, it's hard for
me to live with. Unfortunately, however, that sort of thing sometimes is a part
of being in prison and, in this case, the matter was a little complicated by
the fact that the guy who did the yelling usually conducts himself in a way as
to have very little friction with other people. He does his time quietly doing
a lot of exercising and studying an accounting course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that - "and don't give me any back talk" really got to me and I feel a
little bit cowardly for not calling him on that.  And that may have been
satisfying for my ego and my pride but it would have been really dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I want to maybe surprise you a little at this point by telling you
that everything in this letter has a lot to do with creating better ads and DM
pieces! And don't even try to guess why at this point because I'll explain it
before I am finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back to my story: As I was saying, there was a lot of things I
didn't do and I'd like to talk about why I didn't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason I didn't get tough with this guy is I was a little scared. Not
much, because I am in very good shape and I am a very physical person now. But
I was a little scared and with good reasons and here are some of them. First of
all, this guy might have hurt me. He's pretty physical too and he has been
working out in prison for years. Secondly, I might have hurt him because, as I
said, I'm not exactly a guy who routinely gets sand kicked in his face. And
thirdly, (and this is the big one!) if he and I had gotten in a fight we would
have both been put in chains and immediately transferred to a higher security
prison PLUS we may easily have lost our "good time" and, I myself, would
perhaps have had to do six months longer before I got out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think you'll agree I did the right thing but, I'll tell you, my ol' ego
is having a hard time of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, let's talk briefly about why I didn't explain to him a more mature way he
could have handled the situation. One of the big reasons is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Am In Prison! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, here doing time with me, are a lot of people who would not be here if they
were capable of handling an emotionally charged situation with any kind of
maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does all this have to do with writing sales letters and ads? It has,
as I promised you, quite a lot and here is the gist of it: Now that I've told
you what I didn't do when this situation arose, I want to tell you what I did
do. What I did do was stay in the room and I worked on yesterday's letter to
you.  And, if you will look at that letter you will see that my handwriting was
somewhat shaky because of all the adrenaline working in my system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did write the letter to you and then I took a walk and I went to my
"thinking spot" and I plotted out my schedule for the month of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this morning what I did is I did 8 long miles of roadwork on the hill.
That's 10 laps. In the beginning I walked two to warm up; in the end I walked
two to cool down and in the middle I jogged 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what else did I do? Well, I have sat down and written this letter to you
all about the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, I still haven't gotten to what this has to do with writing a good
sales promotion or, a "good anything" for that matter so, here it is: What I am
doing, Bond, by all this writing and road work is that I am "clearing the deck"
and getting (in so far as possible) this garbage out of my system so that my
strategic decisions and my future letters and ideas will be clear! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember this word: HALT. HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely and
tired and you should never make a decision when you are any of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you do? What I did. Write, run, walk, talk, jog, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be careful who you talk with and write to. You see, it should be someone
who realizes that all this must be considered as "time out babble". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, Bond it really doesn't matter much what the "content" of this letter
is. What matters is that I am going through the "process" of writing it. And it
is the process or physical act of the writing and the road work that does the
therapy. Remember this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You Don't Have To Get It Right... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You Just Have To Get It MOVING! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, in closing, let me tell you another true prison story.  It is about
another encounter I had that was very different than this one. You see, in the
event I just described my roommate wasn't trying to "bulldog" me or shove me
around. He just lost his temper in a childish way and doesn't have the
"emotional tools" to respond to such a situation with maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this other one was different. You see, we have this black guy here at Boron
(never mind his name) who is very strong and very loud. He lifts weights all
the time and he is forever yelling (more prison talk - unprintable). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as it happens, one evening I was playing pool and there weren't enough
pool cues to go around. So what happens is this black guy comes into the pool
room (where everybody but me is black) and starts running his mouth and while
I'm racking the balls he snatches my pool cue and informs me that that is the
way it was going to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked over to him and it got real quiet in that pool room. It got even
quieter when I put my hands on his shoulders and my face right in front of his
and said to him eyeball to eyeball:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Look my friend, here's how it is. This is my stick and you ain't taking it." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I took the stick away from him and resumed playing pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God I Hate This!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as I promised, our subject will be "You Never Get A Second Chance To
Make A First Impression." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to this: When a person goes for a job interview, the interviewer decides
whether or not to hire that person in the first 40-seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this: In a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I promised, our subject will be "You Never Get A Second Chance To
Make A First Impression." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to this: When a person goes for a job interview, the interviewer decides
whether or not to hire that person in the first 40-seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this: In a jury trial, the members of the jury make up their minds as to
whether the accused is guilty or innocent during the first half hour or so
(during the opening argument) and they spend all the rest of the time the trial
takes in finding ways to justify the decision they have already made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this: When a person falls in love it happens almost instantaneously. After
that, minor things like the truth about the newly beloved are cast aside unless
those "truths" happen to reinforce the wonderfulness of said love subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this: You either hook a reader or lose him when he very first looks at your
ad or DM piece. Not when he reads it, but when he first looks at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, this rule is not 100% accurate. Sometimes a person will
suddenly fall in love with a person he or she has known for years; sometimes a
jury will change it's mind after the opening argument; sometimes an interviewer
will decide to hire an applicant he had originally (in his mind) rejected. And,
sometimes, a reader will read and order from your ad, even though he was turned
off by it when he first saw it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't count on this. Most of the time a person will never alter his
original impression. Most of the time he will simply "edit" all new info that
comes to him and "process" it in such a way as to validate his original
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So; what does this mean when it comes to creating advertising?  What it means
is your ad or DM piece should give your prospect a life; should cause his
pupils to dilate as soon as he sees it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I ever tell you that good poker players often watch their opponent's eyes
when they draw new cards? What they are looking for is to see the reaction of
their opponent's eyes to the cards they draw. If their eyes widen, that is if
their pupils dilate that means that they liked the new cards they received. If
their pupils constrict it probably means that what happened is that they
received cards of which they are not fond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a totally involuntary reaction. Apparently, what happens is that when
we see something we like our eyes open up so we can let in more light and see
more of it. And, conversely, when we see something we don't like we do just the
opposite; we try to cut down the flow of light so we don't have to see as much
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I have a theory about all this and what I believe is that most (or many)
of our decisions about how we like or dislike something are made not in 40
seconds or the first 4 or 40 minutes but rather in the first fraction of a
second that we see something new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I further believe that we unconsciously spend the rest of our so called
decision making time not really making a decision after all but instead
searching for justification for the decision we have already made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that's why I'm so careful about the "look" of my DM pieces and MO ads. You
see, I believe the "sale" or "no sale" decision is largely made the instant a
prospect sees your ad and reads your headline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that if your prospect gets an instant "lift" from just looking at your
ad, then he will start reading it and looking for reasons to convince himself
that the promise of your ad is true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you don't disappoint him then you have a really good chance of closing
the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what kind of look will give the reader a lift? It's short of tricky,
really. But I think one thing that helps is if your promotion has a "crisp"
look about it. In other words, the layout should be clean, there should be a
lot of contrast and it should look easy and inviting to read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use pictures they should be, as a general rule, of an upbeat nature. Do
you remember that ad with the before and after pictures of Christi Dean? You
know, almost everybody liked the look of that ad because the "after" picture of
Christi Dean was so uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, before I forget one little-known fact that is kind of interesting
is that women like to see pictures of women in ads and men like to see pictures
of men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget why. I just remember that surveys show this to be true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's something else. That writer that I told you about who wrote for
Printer's Ink? Anyway, his pen name was Old Aesop Glimm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, when it comes to direct mail, there are a number of things you
can do to make your package more likely to give the reader a lift. First of
all, you should use good crisp white paper, both for the pages of the letters
and the envelopes you are mailing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using label addressing (and later we will discuss when you should or
not) you should use a tight white label on a matching envelope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using stamps (and if you follow my advice, you almost always will)
you should, whenever practical, use large colorful commemoratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your letterhead should be dignified and non-distracting. Your type face should
be a serif face and you should make sure your original letter (the one you are
going to use for camera ready art) should be typed with a carbon ribbon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use a second color in your letters to underline words or
something you should use RED. If you enclose a photograph or a simulated
photograph you should make sure it does NOT look cheap, limp and soggy.
Instead, it should look crisp, clean, glossy and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those rules also apply to your enclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am trying to get started again. Once more, I haven't the faintest
idea of what I'm going to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am trying to get started again. Once more, I haven't the faintest
idea of what I'm going to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see now. Oh yeah. When I left off last night one of the last things I
mentioned was how the judicious use of parenthesis (like this) can provide "eye
relief" for your reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright. Now, let's talk a bit more about eye relief. Have you ever looked at a
piece of writing and decided not to read it because it looked so forbidding?
I'll bet you have. Many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this kind of writing will have long sentences, long paragraphs, narrow
side margins, small type and very little white space anywhere on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we certainly don't want people to avoid reading our copy for stupid
reasons like this, do we? You say you agree? Good. In that case, I'll press on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, listen up. When a person first looks at something you have written it
should be something that looks inviting to read.  Easy-to-read. When he looks
at your page of copy he should be drawn to your copy like a convict is to a
Penthouse Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your page of copy (be it letter or space ad) should be laid out in such a
manner as to be an attractive "eye treat" for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means wide margins, a certain amount of white space, double spacing
between paragraphs, short words, short sentences, short paragraphs and an
attractive, inviting layout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, my dear son, you are about to learn one of my very most important
secrets. What I am about to tell you is so important that you can get as much
as 500% more readership. Yet, at the same time, this important consideration
remains almost virtually unknown by almost every agency and advertising person
I have ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen up. Listen good and never forget what you are about to learn. Here it
is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Layout Of Your &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement Should &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catch The Attention Of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Reader... But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not In A Way That Causes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him To "Notice" The Layout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's not as clear as it could be, is it? Perhaps I can do better.
O.K., know this: In most publications, the editorial content gets 5 times as
much readership as the advertising content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does this mean on a practical basis? Simply this: It means that your
ads should, as much as possible, have an "editorial look" about them.  (Better
stop here and go call Blade and then go to "work". Maybe I'll get to rake the
sand again today!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk a bit more about the "look" of your ads and DM pieces. As I said,
they should look (the ads) "editorial".  However, they should not look like
just any old editorial piece of writing. No. Your ads should look like an
exciting piece of editorial material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a way to think about it: Imagine that you have written a book that you
want to become a best seller. What's the best thing that could happen? Well,
how about this? Suppose a guy who works as a reporter for the L.A. Times gets a
copy of your book and reads it and falls in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us further imagine that this reporter likes your book so much that he
writes a full page article about our book and tells all his readers how
wonderful this book is and why they should buy a copy. Wouldn't that be great?
You bet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just to sweeten things up even more, let us suppose that at the end of
this "Rave Review" he tells his readers how to get a copy by mail. He tells
them how much it costs, where to send the check or money order and who the
payment should made out to! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! How about that! A full page rave review that makes the reader desire the
book and then tells him where and how to get it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my son, listen and listen closely. Whenever you write an ad it should look,
in so far as possible, exactly like a rave review written by a reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should have the look of an exciting news flash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something else. You know, whenever I want to study ad layouts, I often
study editorial layouts instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we apply all this to direct mail? O.K., what would that reporter do if
he wanted one of his friends in Hawaii to buy your book? The answer? Well,
perhaps he would write his friend a letter and tell him the same things he told
his newspaper readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, perhaps he would even include a snapshot of the book so his friend would
know what to look for in case he wanted to go to a bookstore to get the book.
This would be one hell of a sales pitch, wouldn't it? You bet it would and
that's how your DM letters should look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a true story. Once upon a time I wrote a letter to sell a product I
dreamed up which was a family name research report.  This little report would
give you a short history of your family name and it contained a black and white
drawing of the earliest known coat-of-arms (family crest) ever to be associated
with your name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you are aware, this became one of the most successful sales letters in
history. In fact, this simple one page 361-word letter generated more than
seven million (actually 7,156,000) cash with order customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, eh? But listen to what happened next! Obviously, we wanted to sell
these research report buyers other products and the logical course of action
was to send them a catalog showing a bunch of products they could get that
would display (in full heraldic colors!) their family crest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound good to you? It sounded great to me. So, what I did is I went off on a
camping trip by myself and there, all alone in the woods, I created a 5-1/2 x
8-1/2 four color catalog which featured about 70 attractive items that could be
ordered personalized with my customer's family crest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bombed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't even return our mailing costs! So, what next? Well, at that point,
what I did is I took the 3 best selling items in the catalog and I put together
an 8-1/2 x 11 brochure that featured only 3 items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did only slightly better than break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groan. What to do, what to do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I did then: I wrote a very personal sales letter and I enclosed a
snapshot of the best selling of the three items in the brochure. The opening of
the letter went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Noble, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you might like to see what the Noble coat-of-arms looks like in full
 color so I am sending you the enclosed snapshot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc., blah, blah, blah, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 Million Dollars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right kiddo. That letter brought in 40 mil while my other "more
professional" attempts fell flat on their rears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the moral here? The moral is YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT
FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, when I come back, the subject of my next teaching will be the importance
of the fact that "YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the last thing I wrote about was how I want you to take the Tova

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the last thing I wrote about was how I want you to take the Tova
"facelift ad" and copy it in your handwriting. I also said you should do this
just as you would if you were going to take it to a secretarial service and
have it typed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's more: From now on, for the next 4 or 5 months I want you to do this same
thing with other ads and DM pieces. But I don't want you to just copy any old
ad or DM piece. I want you to copy only the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's why I want you to do all this: You see, what happens when you
actually write out a good ad in your own handwriting is that the words and the
flow and the sentence structure and the sequence of information and everything
else about the writing of that ad becomes a part of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just an empty experience. This is a way of internally imprinting on
your mind and body, the process of good writing. If you do this often enough
you will soon have a deep "inside out" understanding of what it takes and what
it feels like to write a good piece of copy. Now, in the beginning I want you
to allow me and Blade to pick which ads and DM pieces for you to copy. And, of
course, the ones we will select for you to write out in your own handwriting
will be those that we already know to be the cream of the crop. Ads and DM
pieces that are proven winners. Ones that have brought in millions and even
tons of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to do this. It is one of the many disciplines that other lazy
"would be" marketing geniuses will not suffer.  That's too bad for them and
good for us. I love that my so called "competition" is so lazy. I love it that
so many people in advertising and marketing are too sophisticated, too "above"
this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a little tale about a man I very much respect who was not above
doing this sort of thing. He wanted to become a great writer (he was!) and so
what he did was take great books and copy them (in a sense he was actually
writing them) in his own handwriting just as I am instructing you to do. He did
this for a long time. Now here is something else he took the trouble to do:
Since one of the books he wanted to write involved what it was like to cross
the ocean under horrible conditions, what he did was travel the ocean himself
in the bowels of rusty old freighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, naturally, before he was finished he had an internal deep rooted
"cellular" knowledge of the process of writing a good book and he also knew
what it was like to travel the ocean in misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did all of this pay off? You bet is did. This man's name is Arthur Haley and
his book "Roots" is one of the best sellers of all time. &lt;/p&gt;

for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here are a few other tips on how to write good copy or , as a matter of
fact, "good anything". Use simple common everyday words. Use "get" instead of
"procure." Write short sentences and short paragraphs. Use "transition" words
and phrases to make your writing flow smoothly. Do you notice how I use
transition words and phrases such as the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as a matter of fact, I first blah... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, naturally, we don't want to blah, blah...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, here is what she said blah, blah, blah...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's a few more great ideas: Ask questions once in a while and then
answer them yourself. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond, do you understand what I am saying? You do. Good, then let's go on. Etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we get the benefits? The answer is simple. All we have to do is etc.,
etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine that? I know it seems unbelievable but facts are facts! Etc.,
etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. God I love to write "And so on." Kurt Vonnegut uses it quite often
and he is one of the best writers I've read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a good writer? Well, in my opinion a good writer is one who makes
things perfectly clear. He makes it easy for the reader. Easy-to-understand
what he is saying, easy to keep reading. And, if you want a treat, if you want
to read an entertaining book written with great clarity, then read Vonnegut's
"Breakfast of Champions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, don't get me wrong. I said the book was written clearly, I did not say it
was written by a sane person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, do you notice how little one word transition sentences like
"onward." keep the flow going? You say you do notice? O.k., smarty, see if you
can answer this question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: What is the best way of becoming a good writer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! You're not absolutely certain about this one, are you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Best Way To Become &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Good Writer... Is By...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing Good Writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, that's what the subject of this entire letter is all about.
Don't worry about developing a "style." Your own peculiarities will emerge soon
enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember this. (Ran out of ink) The very best writing goes unnoticed.
That's right. You don't want someone to read one of your ads and say "Gosh,
that advertisement was sure well written!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. What you really want is for the reader to order from your ad. Listen up
dummy. "If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty
pockets!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write for money! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something else to keep in mind: It is a good idea to know "word
pictures" that will help your reader vicariously experience the wonderful
benefits of owning your product or service. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And, just wait till you step into that warm inviting jacuzzi that comes with
every apartment. Man oh man! The feel of that soothing bubbling water against
your bare skin is just plain heaven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You've heard of the expression about how you won't believe your eyes? Well,
this is one time you won't believe your eyes.  No kidding. The delightful aroma
of these charcoal broiled steaks will remind you how good it feels to be
genuinely hungry" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wow! When I first felt her tongue going around and around on my skin I thought
I was going to scream!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc. (I'm tired. These are not great examples but they'll do for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got 4 minutes to go. What can I teach you in that amount of time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a little something: You can make your copy easier to read by the
judicious use of parentheses. For example, if you want to tell people that your
offer is good anywhere in the U.S.  (except Alaska) the proper use of
parentheses, as I just did, makes the copy easier-to-read, easier to understand
and provides a little "eye relief" for your reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIDA. As I said yesterday, it stands for attention, interest, desire, and
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's talk about each of these four formula elements and how we will use
them in our sales letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention comes first. Naturally, we must get our readers attention before he
can become interested …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIDA. As I said yesterday, it stands for attention, interest, desire, and
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's talk about each of these four formula elements and how we will use
them in our sales letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention comes first. Naturally, we must get our readers attention before he
can become interested in and desirous of our offer. Getting attention is
CRUCIAL. If you don't get it, your letter or advertisement will never be read.
That's why I like to attach things to the top of my DM letters. I have attached
coins, dollar bills, 2-dollar bills, Japanese &lt;em&gt;pennies&lt;/em&gt;, Mexican pesos etc. and
there gimmicks has always gotten a lot of attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I told you before, you must get the right kind of attention. If
not, your reader will be insulted and angry and probably won't become a
customer. So, always remember that your attention grabber needs to be relevant.
It needs to tie in naturally with your letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as we have discussed, we have decided to attach a plastic baggie filled
with sand to the letter we are going to use to sell our report on real estate
investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that this technique will get our reader's attention. It will
really make him sit up and take notice. It will be the right kind of attention
too. Because it is relevant.  It has a natural tie in with the story our letter
has to tell.  Actually, we have, as you will recall, more or less written this
part of the letter in an earlier lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK now, we have got attention and our first few paragraphs have made a natural
tie in with our &lt;em&gt;attention grabber.&lt;/em&gt; So, what's next? Well, referring right
back to our AIDA formula we see that the next thing we need to do (after
getting his attention) is catch his interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we do this? Well, let's start by feeding him interesting facts. Like how
much money there is to be made by investing in Maui real estate. By telling how
much sand (cubic tons) is on the beach where we got the sand in that baggie. By
telling how this is one of the best beach front investment opportunities in
Maui. By telling how many pretty girls there are around. By telling the
specific kinds of fish you can catch right off the beach etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now after we have told him a lot of interesting facts our AIDA formula now
tells us we should now arouse his desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Bondo Dog, things get curiouser and curiouser. I just got fired from my
job. I'll tell you the story when you visit; there's really not much to say and
it's kind of boring so let's get back to our letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, meanwhile back at the ranch I believe we were talking about how to create
desire and, as I was saying, here's how we do that: What we do to create desire
is we describe the benefits our prospect gets if he buys our product or
service. Now, in the case of an investment orientated offer what we have to
offer is the prospect of making money. At least this is our main attraction.
So, what's let's do is let's help him to picture in his mind the benefits of
having more money. Don't think it's not necessary. Remember, you must always do
even the obvious.  Here then, are some benefits of having more money: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New car - impress your friends and family, ride in comfort and luxury &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice house - comfort, luxury, and status &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace of mind - no worries about bills or financial emergencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacations - money lets you travel the world, go where you want when you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attract the opposite sex - money, as any fool knows, makes you much more
attractive to the opposite sex - it gives you more opportunities to meet them
in nice places also &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leisure time - money buys time: perhaps the best reason of all for having fun
goes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright kiddo, we've got his attention, we've got him interested, created
desire and now what's left? Go back to our AIDA formula and you will see that
that last &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; stands for action. And that's just what we've got to get, action!
Action in the form of him sending us an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should pay very close attention to how I get action in my MD and DM
pitches. I do this better than anybody. I am very thorough when it comes to
closing a sale. Here's a little of example of how I do it. &lt;em&gt;Would you like to
get in on this great investment opportunity? Would you like to be one of the
privileged few who actually own a piece of the finest beach in Maui? If so,
it's easy to order. All you have to do is fill out the order coupon and send it
to me with your payment, etc., etc.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to stress is that you must be very clear, very specific about
what you want him to do. Lead him by the hand and take him exactly where you
want him to go. Tell him where the order coupon is. Tell him to fill it out.
Tell him to enclose the payment. Tell him how much to send. Tell him who the
checks and money orders should be made out to. Tell him to use the envelope.
Tell him the envelope doesn't need a stamp. (If it doesn't.) Tell him to put
the envelope in the mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, above all, tell him to do all this RIGHT NOW! TODAY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell him what he will get if he hurries and tell him what he will lose if he
delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, Bond, you should read my ads and DM pieces and pay particular
attention to how I close the sales. Sometimes I devote as 25% or more of the
entire ad to closing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, has been just a few &lt;em&gt;starter ideas&lt;/em&gt; on how to create a DM
promotion. As I keep saying, I'm just warming up and will get more detailed
later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple days or so, I intend to send you Eric's sales letter and I
want you to read it and then see if you can see how everything I taught you in
the last few days would make his letter more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in the meantime, I have an assignment for you. Here's what I want you to
do: what I want you to do is get a copy of the facelift ad and then sit down
and copy it in your own handwriting. I want you to write it out just the way
you would if you were going to take it to a secretarial service to have it
typed. By the way, check with B on this and he'll tell you what format your
hand written copy should be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? After you have completed this assignment I will explain why I
am having you do this and how it will help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know son, you are the joy of my life. I hope you pass your driver's test
today. But, if you don't, it's ok, just keep working on it till you do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as you remember, we left off after discussing the baggie and today,
I think I need to begin to teach you the particulars of how to write copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will note, we haven't talked about writing copy as of yet. What we have
talked about mainly is the &lt;em&gt;"conceptualization"&lt;/em&gt; of our marketing effort.
However, now that we have conceptualized our piles, let's get a little more
technical about the whole process of writing copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how to begin: The first thing you need to do is to assemble a file that
contains everything you can get your hands on that is relevant to your
promotion. Here are some of the things that might be included in your file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List cards describing the lists you are going to test &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the report you intend to sell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of DM pieces that other people have used to sell products or services
related to what you want to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of space ads that other people have used to sell products or services
related to what you want to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of books and reports on real estate investing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of exceptionally good ads and DM pieces, even if they are not related
to real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of that book I'm going to give you that contains hundreds of
headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything else you can think of that might be an &lt;em&gt;idea generator&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK now, after you have assembled all this stuff, what you need to do is start
reading and taking notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here is a little quirk of mine: I have a special way of taking these notes
which, incidentally, I call &lt;em&gt;nugget notes.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, what I do is take my notes in the form of little nuggets of
information. When I am done the paper I have been writing on looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this when you are taking these notes don't stuff yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, my nugget notes consist of just one word. Sometimes they consist of
meaningless phrases. Many times my notes make sense but many times they don't.
No matter. I never worry about it. I just keep writing. I write what occurs to
me as I read the list cards, the jackets of books, the ads, the DM pieces, and
all the rest of the material I have assembled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here are a few things you should always include. A complete description of
your product including how many pages, how many words, how many photos, who
wrote it, facts about the author (his age, background, success stories, etc.).
You should also take notes on what this product will do for you. Will it make
you wealthy? How will more money help your customer? Will he be able to buy a
better car? Take more vacations? Afford a better home? If so, put it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK now, after you have taken all these notes what I want you to do is re-read
the notes and the really good ones, put a star * beside them. And the ones that
are even better put two stars &lt;strong&gt; next to them. And then, the red hot ones you
put three &lt;/strong&gt;* or more stars beside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point, what you need to do is stop working on this project. That's
right. Just let it go. Put it right out of your mind. Just go on about your
other business for a day or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now then, often what happens during this time, is that an outstanding sales
idea will occur to you. Sometimes this idea will be how to get attention like
with my baggie idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond, I got interrupted here. Two prison guards came over and searched me and
B. and told us to stay out of the little park where we take our breaks.
Apparently, some little kid was caught smoking pot here yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well, that's life in the big city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's get started again. As I was saying, sometimes your breakthrough idea
or &lt;em&gt;aha experience&lt;/em&gt; will be a way to get attention like my baggie idea, or a
new way to help the prospect visualize the benefits of owning what you have to
sell, or a new order generating sales point or whatever. Anyway, at this point
you now need to begin writing your letter according to formula.  By formula I
mean you should work within a proven sequential outline like AIDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does AIDA stand for? It stands for ATTENTION, INTEREST, DESIRE, ACTION.
So, to make it clearer your letter should: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get his attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, get him interested&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, make him desire what you are selling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compel him to take whatever action is needed to get whatever it is you are
selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we'll go over this in more detail. But for today, once again I want
to wish you HAPPY BIRTHDAY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to talk about that baggie full of dirt that we have attached
to our real estate investment sales letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, listen up. While it is true that you must attract attention to your
advertisements and sales letters, it is also true that your "attention …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to talk about that baggie full of dirt that we have attached
to our real estate investment sales letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, listen up. While it is true that you must attract attention to your
advertisements and sales letters, it is also true that your "attention grabber"
should be relevant. It should tie in with your message. It should make sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a guy who wrote a series of articles for a magazine
called "Printers Ink." I forget the guys pen name but he was very good. He
wrote about how to improve DM &amp;amp; MO advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anyway, he once called an excellent example of how you should NOT attract
attention. Check out this headline: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Submarine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That Flies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, beneath that headline was the copy: "No, we don't have a submarine
that flies but our pink pills, etc., etc." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cheap shot. People resent this kind of fraud. Don't do it. If you put your
mind to work you won't have to either. You can grab attention without
"cheating", without making the reader feel ripped off. Which brings me right
back to our dirt filled baggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember how I explained that the baggie has our reader wondering why
you sent it to him? That he wants to know what's going on here? That we have
his focused attention? Quality attention? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say you do remember all that? Good. In that case, I'll proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's how the letter will start off: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Tiberion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am attaching a plastic baggie to the top of this letter for two important
 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what I have to say to you is very serious and I needed some way
 to be sure to get your attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And secondly, what is inside that baggie could very well be your passport to
 complete financial independence! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? The answer is simple: You see, what is inside that baggie is a
 very tiny amount of what is the most valuable thing on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about real estate and, in this case, Hawaiian Real Estate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true. The sand inside that baggie was taken directly from a certain
 beach on the island of Maui and this particular beach is one of the few left
 that is open for purchase to private investors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it's all about: blah, blah, blah, etc., etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K., Bondodog, do you follow what I'm doing here? You see, what I did is I got
his attention and then I tied my copy to my "attention grabber" in a relevant
way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if I were to continue writing this letter, I would use words that would
make my reader "picture with pleasure" that beach in his mind. Before I was
finished, he would be able to feel the sand in his toes, smell the fresh tang
of the salt air, drink in the stars with his eyes and feel the warm friendly
sun on his back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, just a couple days ago, I received from Eric a copy of a sales
letter he is writing to sell Hawaiian real estate. I am going to send Eric's
letter to you real soon and I want you to read it and then imagine how much his
letter could be improved by using all the little secrets (including the baggie)
that we have just discussed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well oh well, what have we got so far? Let's see: we picked out our list, we
know how to think about outside envelopes and return envelopes, we have thought
up a way to get our reader's attention and we have the first couple paragraphs
of our letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in most cases, we need more than a letter and a reply envelope. Yes, in
most cases, it is good to include an order card and some type of printed
brochure. I like to include an order card and a brochure with my sales letters.
However, I do not like to let my reader see my order card, etc. as soon as he
opens the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why? That's right. I don't want him to realize that I want to sell
him something until I am well into my pitch. Here is something else you should
know: Many people, when they read an ad, read it like this... What they do is,
they read the headline first and then they go right to the order coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with direct mail letters. If your reader sees your order card
as soon as he opens your envelope, he will read it first to see what the deal
is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that's not good for us. It is true, of course, that we do want him to read
our order card but we want him to read it at the proper time! And the proper
time is after he has read our letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprende? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how in the world do we include an order card and/or a sales brochure in
our envelope and still hide it (temporarily) from our reader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, it took me years to figure this out. And, just like the
paperclip, it is so simple, you wonder why you didn't see it instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I do it: What I do is, take an 8-1/2x11 piece of paper and cut it in
half long ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I fold the cut pieces in thirds like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, turn the piece around and write this on the back: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Open this paper to find the special info mentioned in 
 my letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now, that which I have just written should be printed in blue ink and
appear to be handwritten. Notice that it refers him to my letter and it is
personalized with my initials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is what he will see when he finally opens that note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Is The Info I Mentioned In My Letter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~     (Boxed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~           Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~       Here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Order Coupon)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K., kiddo, here is my final point for the day. Although I like my letters to
be personal, in most cases, I also like them to be "businesslike personal". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that's why part of the package should be typeset and maybe contain some
photographs. Your see, this adds an air of stability to your promotion. It
makes you seem like a real business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I want to emphasize that in order to make it easy to order (and to
credential our offer) we need stuff like order cards, brochures, photos, and
typeset copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, again, as I said, we want our reader to see this stuff at the proper time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFTER HE HAS READ OUR LETTER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple things need to be updated regarding this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, computers have made it so BREs (Business Reply Envelopes) no
longer are slowed very much for tabulating purposes. This letter was written
before high-speed computers were so wide spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this was written when phone calls other than local calls were costly and
reply envelopes were more important. THEY STILL ARE, but when testing the phone
order option, many times only being able to order over the phone works best and
more and more the phone and internet are becoming the preferred ways to order..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the phone, there is no delay and as pop says, "in sales, delay is death."
The things that can happen between reading copy and sending a check in the mail
is far greater than the things that can happen between reading the copy and
picking up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last note is that my dad preferred hiding the BRE in an envelope marked "Do
not open until you have read my letter".  More often than not he put an order
coupon in there too. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 13</title><link href="/chapter-13.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-24T09:02:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-24T09:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-24:/chapter-13.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've found myself a little hideaway near the top of "The Hill" and I am
sitting cross-legged (yoga style) on a blanket and I am looking out over good
old Camp Boron and writing you this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you pay attention to yesterday's lessons? Have you noticed how I have
already used, in this letter, many of the little ideas I talked about
yesterday? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did notice? Good. Then I guess it's safe to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I do (there's a baby rabbit about 7 yards from me!) I want to tell
you that I just talked to your mom and it put some pain in my brain. She works
hard and now that I am in here she more or less feels she's out there all alone
against the wolves.  Rick wants money. Chuck wants money. Your mom has bills
and I feel very pressured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you once said the smartest thing I've ever heard a kid say.  You said that
you were luckier than Jeff because when Jeff lived with me I was already rich
and that you get to be with me when I am not rich and, therefore, you get to
learn how I solve problems, especially money problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe we can both learn something today. (NOTE: I say "well" almost as
often as Ronnie Reagan, don't I?) What I feel like doing is sniveling. I'd love
to take some drugs or alcohol and forget my problems. Or maybe just lie on my
bunk all day and read a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least I'd like to eat. But I can't. I can't because this is my day
to fast. And to write to you. And to Z. And to work on a new ad for L. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, so I shall. Not because (that bunny is still right here!) I want to but,
rather, because I need to. You see, when things are tough I have discovered
that a very very simple (but effective) thing to do is just keep moving in some
sort of positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And... and... let's talk about envelopes and little baggies filled with dirt.
O.K. as I recall, I was just about to tell you how to use a SRE to induce guilt
in a regular commercial DM sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how: What you do is write something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and so, Mr. Jones, as you can see, what I am offering you is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a piece of a legalized Nevada whorehouse.
I hope you can take advantage of this offer.  But, if you can't, would you
please drop me a note and tell you can't participate at this time. That way
I'll feel free to make this exciting offer to someone else. I've enclosed a
self-addressed envelope and I have even put a stamp on it because (either way)
it is important that I hear from you right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, please -- reply today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many lessons in that little block of copy. First of all, it's not just a guilt
inducer, it also develops a strong selling point: Namely, the selling point of
this being a genuine limited offer that some other lucky person will take
advantage of it you don't. And, the stamped envelope tends to "credential" that
point. (I just made a noise and my little bunny slipped away.) Here's something
else: If you can get a person who is not going to order to agree, in his mind,
to write and tell you he is not going to, then you will get more orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you guess why? Aha, you didn't get this one, did you, smart alec? No
matter. I'll tell you why. You see, what happens sometimes is that a person who
is getting a pen or pencil and a piece of paper in order to write you and tell
you "No" will sometimes start thinking like this: "Well, you jerk. I'd kind of
like to get in on this deal anyway and now that I've got the pen and paper I
may as well go ahead and order."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's switch our discussion to another kind of envelope
where you also pay the postage for your customer. I'm talking 
about, of course, the good old standby known as a BRE or
"Business Reply Envelope".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen thousands of BRE's. They look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most mailers love BRE's. They have the advantage of making it easy for the
customer to reply plus the advantage of being much cheaper than a stamped reply
envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they are cheaper is that you only pay the postage (and BRE fee) for
those envelopes that are actually mailed back to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they also have some disadvantages. Like these: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.They slow up your mail. The post office has to tabulate how many BRE's you
get each day so they'll know how much you owe. This will hold up your mail (and
your cash flow!) for at least one extra day. Maybe more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.They telegraph that yours is not, in fact, a real personal letter. You know,
sooner or later, you've got to let your potential customers know that you want
him to buy something.  However, if you let him know immediately quite often he
won't even give you a hearing. And, in truth, this is a disservice to him.
Because, quite often, after he reads your info he will discover that what you
have to offer has genuine value to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So try to strategize your mailings so that he at least reads your letter before
he makes a decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.You can't do good guilt with a BRE. SRE's are much better for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, let's talk about yet another type of reply envelope. I call it the PSH
envelope. PSH stands for "Place Stamp Here".  They look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______                        
                            
                                                                
 Place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;______                  
                                                                
                                  Stamp &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;____

&lt;p&gt;Las
Vegas, NV  20215&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most economical reply envelope of all. That's because (obviously)
the customer pays the postage. Let's talk about this envelope: First of all,
it's not as convenient for the customer so you will lose some orders because of
that. On the other hand, this envelope is more personal so you will gain some
orders because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Guess what, Bondy? I think a solution to your mom's money problems just popped into my mind!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, this envelope isn't as personal as an SRE but it is more than a
regular BRE. It is, as I have pointed out, cheaper than both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it is, then, is cheaper than a SRE and more personal than a BRE and, in my
judgment, this is the best envelope for most mailers to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More mailers should test PSH envelopes and carefully analyze the results. Many
of them are going to be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAMN! I'm getting a little tired of writing about envelopes. I think I'll
switch over to discussing that little baggie filled with dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my hour is up and I've got to go stand count. (They want to know where
I am all the time. They must like me!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in again tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Bond's Notes, see chapter 14&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 12</title><link href="/chapter-12.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-23T10:02:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-23T10:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-23:/chapter-12.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get right back to that real estate letter. I've already pointed out how
that little baggie filled with dirt will attract and focus our reader's
attention. Now, let's talk about the other particulars of the first page of
that letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I left off in my …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get right back to that real estate letter. I've already pointed out how
that little baggie filled with dirt will attract and focus our reader's
attention. Now, let's talk about the other particulars of the first page of
that letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I left off in my last letter where I was just about to comment on the
part above the salutation, the part that tells the day of the week, the exact
time, the day of the month and the year. Why is it important to put these
specifics in the letter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it makes the letter a little more personal, doesn't it? I mean seriously,
don't you feel a little closer to me because I put all this data in each of my
letters to you? I think so. I think this way of doing things bonds the writer
and the reader closer together. It also gives our transmission the quality of
immediacy. And, while I'm on the subject, it just occurred to me that I should
tell you that another additional way to achieve this bond of intimacy and
immediacy in your letters is to describe where you are and what you are doing
as you are writing the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, right now I am sitting cross-legged on my back here in room 7 of
dorm 6 in the Boron Federal Prison Camp. I have just finished running the hill
five times (4-miles) and I did it in 57 minutes and 5 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how this type of personal specific info bonds the reader and writer
closer together? You do? Good. I'll continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's another little thought: When you tell the day of the week plus the
exact time you are writing the letter, it makes it seem a more important
communication too, doesn't it? Sort of like a telegram. There's no doubt about
it: A time-dated communication carries considerable more weight than one which
is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about the salutation. Notice that the salutation addresses our
reader by name, just like I do in these letters to you. "Dear Bond" gets a
certain quality of focused attention that is not enjoyed by "Dear Sir" or "Dear
Occupant" or "Dear Reader". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. When you read the words "Dear Bond", you know my letter is for
you personally, don't you? It's not for Kevin.  It's not for whoever owns the
house. Or anybody who lives at the address on the envelope. No. The words "Dear
Bond" indicate that this letter is for you and you alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this makes you pay more attention, doesn't it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you will look in the lower right hand corner of the letter in my
illustration and, also, in all of my other letters, you will see, in
parenthesis, a tiny little instruction like this: (over) or like this: (go to
page 7). What I am doing here is taking the reader by the hand and leading him
exactly where I want him to go. It seems like a small point and, maybe it is,
but is the little touches like this that keeps the letter flowing, the reader
moving along, and, it relieves him of the burden of trying to figure out what
he is supposed to do when he finishes reading a particular page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't scoff. Quite often (most often) your letter will arrive when your
prospect is busy, when his mind is on other things.  Therefore, you need to
work hard to make reading your letter pleasant, easy-read, interesting and
unconfusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am once again starting to write without knowing where I am going.
All I know is that when I keep moving and writing and flowing that generally
something decent emerges.  We'll see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, wait. I know what I'll tell you. How about what else goes inside the
carrier envelope in addition to the letter? One thing for sure is that you must
include a reply envelope. Now, when it comes to reply envelopes, you basically
have two choices. The options are to make the reader pay the postage when he
mails the envelope or for you to pay the postage for him. There are two ways
for you to pay the postage. One of these is to simply put a "live" stamp on the
envelope so that it will be all ready to mail when he receives it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of advantages to this strategy and one big disadvantage. The
disadvantage is cost. Right now, at 20Â¢ per stamp it will cost you $200.00
extra per thousand to do business this way. And, naturally, because of this,
most mailers never even test this option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's too bad. Really. Because sometimes, this strategy will pay off.
Therefore, I believe, when either or both of the following conditions exists
you should test a SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condition #1: You are selling a high-ticket item where the profit structure is
such that one additional sale per thousand letters mailed will yield more than
enough profit to pay for your SRE's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, of course, that each sale you make has to have a mark up of at
least $200.00. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? What I just wrote may not be quite accurate.  Because, if you
think about it, if those SRE's bring in two or more orders per M, then your
mark up on each sale would only have to be $100.00. If they bring in three
extra orders per M, the mark up would only have to be $70.00 per unit to make
it feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condition #2: You should test a SRE whenever you can make the recipient of your
letter feel guilty if he doesn't reply. This works especially well for charity
or fund raising letters. For example, you might have a line in one of your
letters that goes something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"...and those pitiful children need your help right now! So please send a check
immediately and send as much as possible.  That's all you have to do. I have
already addressed the reply envelope and I have even gone to the expense of
putting a stamp on it so you won't have to hunt for one!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty good guilt, eh? And you can also use guilt in a regular sales letter.
Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued Tomorrow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to add or detract from this letter at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paragraph in which he wrote about, where he is sitting while writing the
letter holds great meaning to me personally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father and I have both always been people who loved to go see places we have
read about in books and magazines or places we have seen in the movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop went to Jamaica to see all the places where they filmed Doctor No and even
stayed in the Fleming Estate before it was a specialty tourist hotel. He said
he sat at the desk where Ian Fleming wrote some of the Bond novels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a lark, I was looking up the old Boron Prison Camp and decided to take a
drive out there. As it turns out, it is now an abandoned property. Most of the
structures while stripped of anything of value, are still labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave me a chance to see inside Boron beyond the visiting areas and actually
walk the hill my father speaks of in the letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular paragraph inspires me to put more detailed info of where I am
while writing my letters to my kids, because it is really neat to be able to
know exactly where he was at that moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His note about being more personal couldn't be more on target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quick personal note. As you can plainly see my father and I were never
ashamed to show each other affection and now that he is gone, knowing that we
were that close brings me more solace than anything else he could have done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 11</title><link href="/chapter-11.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-22T09:07:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-22T09:07:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-22:/chapter-11.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I left you yesterday, we had just came up with a working title for our real
estate investment report. I believe it was "The Amazing L.A.  Roadmap To Real
Estate Riches!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can come up with a better title but this one is fine. At least for
now. I believe we have also discussed extracting the goodies from several real
estate books and we have collected and examined other DM pieces and MO ads for
books and so forth that deal with real estate investments. We know how to
choose a list to test and now it's time for us to create the DM promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we are going to discuss is the outside envelope. This is where
most mailers mess up first. You see, what most mailers do is put so-called
"teaser copy" on the outside envelope and, in general, design the envelope so
that it is very obvious that it contains a sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will turn the page, I will show you what a typical direct mail outer
envelope looks like. Whoops. We're here already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty obvious, isn't it? In time, you are going to read my semi-famous A-Pile,
B-Pile lecture. But here is a preview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my contention that everybody divides their mail every day into two piles.
An "A-Pile" and a "B-Pile". The "A" pile contains letters that appear to be
personal. Like letters from friends, relatives, business associates, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the "B" pile contains those envelopes that, like the example
above, obviously, contain a commercial message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's the way it works: Everybody always opens all of their "A" pile
mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for obvious reasons. After all, everybody wants to read their personal
mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the "B" pile mail? Does it always get opened? No. It doesn't.
Sometimes it is thrown away immediately without the envelope ever being opened.
Sometimes, if it looks interesting, "B" pile envelopes will be set aside for
later examination. And, of course, sometimes... IF the envelope looks
interesting, or IF the person receiving it has some idle time, or IF the person
is bored and has nothing else to do, than, MAYBE the "B" pile envelopes will be
opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite obviously, people aren't getting to order from you unless they read your
promotion and, also, quite obviously, they can't read your promotion unless
they open the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my dear son, what is our first objective here, as we begin to design
our DM promotion? You are right! Our first objective is to get our envelope
into the "A" pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it's so easy to do! All we have to do is make the envelope look personal.
(Or at least we will take pains so it doesn't look commercial.) Here is what
our envelope should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20Â¢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;209 - 5th
Ave.                                                                                                                                 
Live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York, NY
10049                                                                                                                    
Stamp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{corner card with return address
ONLY;                                                                                          
{an honest-to-God live 
               no company
name}                                                                                                            
1st class stamp}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2193 - 7th St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akron, OH  10104&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{a handwritten or typed address; no label}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everybody who receives this envelope will open it. Why? The answer, as a
copywriter would say, is simple. A person who gets this envelope will open it
to find out what is inside. Because it is intriguing. Because it looks
personal. Because it might be from someone he knows. Because it does not
OBVIOUSLY contain a personal message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my dear son, for all these good reasons, the person who gets this envelope
will open it in order to find out what is inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the "B" pile envelope let's the recipient know right from the jump
that it contains a commercial message. And, of course, the recipient ALREADY
KNOWS that this envelope does not contain any sort of personal communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad. Too bad for the mailer, that is. Because, and this should be painfully
apparent, because if only half as many people open your envelope, only half as
many even have a CHANCE to order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obvious, so simple and so OVERLOOKED!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true. As obvious as this should be, it is missed by almost every
advertising agency and nearly every so-called "direct mail expert" in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'll get off my podium. If I haven't made my point by now, shame on me.
And, now, let's assume that we have designed an "A" pile envelope and we are
relatively sure that our envelope will be opened. What's next? What's next is
that we must now get our potential customer to begin reading our sales letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we do that? Well, let's start by getting his attention. And intriguing
the heck out of him right from the start. Let's try this: Let's get a little
plastic baggie and put some dirt in it and then attach it to the top of our
letter. Here is what the letter will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{little zip lock baggie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;attached here with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dirt inside}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, 6:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 12, 1984&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{typed day and date and time}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Jones,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{personal salutation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{body copy}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{body copy}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{body copy}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(over)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{little directive that tells the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reader what to do from here}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention: What I have just shown you contains several of my little-known
DM secrets. Let's examine them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, that little baggie filled with dirt just sort of reaches right
out and grabs you, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you received this letter, wouldn't you be wondering, "What's in this
baggie?" "Is that dirt in there?" "Why would somebody be sending me a baggie of
dirt?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, consciously or unconsciously, you would be thinking, "I better read this
and find out what it is all about."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you see, we now have not only captured our reader's attention, we have
gotten his "focused" attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what about that part right above the salutation? The part that contains
the day, date and time. What is the significance of all this?  Tune in tomorrow
and see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ram (jogged) the hill 5 times non-stop in 58 minutes and 18 seconds
and after the run I weighed 176-1/2 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically his famous A-pile B-pile speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to expand on something about getting your letter or sales pitch
through to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher the price of your product and/or if your reader is likely to
have someone screen their mail, then a little more is needed than a simple
envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He still never resorted to teaser copy because it brings on what he
called the "oh yuck" factor, basically alerting everyone that it is junk mail.
The only things I have ever seen my dad put on the outside of envelopes with a
sales pitch were "First Class" or "Personal" in red ink but never did anything
give any clue as to what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here I sit for the second day in a row starting my letter to you without
knowing exactly what I am going to write about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blade tells me there seems to be some confusion over my gambling deal with
(name deleted) in Las Vegas. This has me upset. I am trying to get (name
deleted) on the telephone and clear up this matter. Unfortunately, though, it
is clouding my mind at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as you will recall, I just started writing and, lo and behold,
something excellent came out. You know Bond, that fact contains a lesson in
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the lesson is that when you get stuck or emotionally jammed up one of the
ways to get yourself unclogged and flowing again is just to keep moving. Run.
Walk. Jog. Write. Do the dishes. Or whatever. But don't sit around waiting for
a flash from Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work that way. Not often anyway. The key is movement! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see now. Hopefully I've got you doing road work, strengthening your
muscles, fasting one day a week and eating well plus interfacing (isn't that a
dandy buzzword?) with hot mail order publications and the "SRDS" list book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's next? I know. Let's start teaching you how to actually create an ad or a
good direct mail promotion. Here's how to get started. The first thing I'd like
you to do is get a hold of two books. One is "Scientific Advertising" by Claude
Hopkins and the other is "The Robert Collier Letter Book" by Robert Collier.
Ask Blade and Eric for help with getting these books. Read both of these books.
Read "The Robert Collier Letter Book" two times and read "Scientific
Advertising" three times. The first time you read these books do so at your own
pace. Don't take notes. Just read for enjoyment. However, after the first
reading, I want you to take notes as you read the books the second and third
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K., the next thing you need to do is get yourself a copy of my book that has
"2001 Headlines" and read it. Then get Ben Suarez's book "SuperBiz" and read
the headlines in his book.  Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make yourself a collection (a "swipe file") of good ads and good DM pieces and
read them and take notes. (Eric and Blade can help.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now, after all this you should be ready to start the process. Let's
concentrate on DM. Here's how to create a DM promotion from scratch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 - Keep going through the "SRDS" book and looking at lists until you find
one that you want to try to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 - Let's pretend you have chosen a list of people who have bought a book
on how to make money in real estate. Now what you need to do is get three or
four hot books in investing in real estate and read them and take notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3 - OK now, you should get as many DM pieces and space ads on real estate
investing you can find. Read these and take notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 - By now ideas will be churning around in your mind because you have fed
your brain a lot of good stuff to work with. What you do at this point is go
back and review your notes from "The Robert Collier Letter Book" and
"Scientific Advertising" and read those headlines again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, by now, I can almost guarantee that a central selling idea will have
emerged from your cunning little mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't know what that idea will be but let's say you have figured out how
to personalize and customize your real estate investment offer as I discussed
yesterday. And now, let's say your idea is to promise your potential customer
that you are going to tell him how to buy real estate in his area with no money
down. Then, your letter might start something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. X,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there is now a way to buy L.A. real estate without making any
down payment whatsoever? Etc., etc., blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that first sentence will be customized for every customer depending
where he lives. Note: In this example I am assuming we are using computer
letters. So, anyway, the letters would say  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"to buy L.A. real estate"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"to buy Detroit real estate" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"to buy Key West real estate"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc., etc. Now, pay attention. Let's examine a way to "double customize" this
offer. Let's say we have found a list of people in a specific occupation who
like to invest such as cardiologists for example. Now, let's start our letter
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. X,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there is now a way for a cardiologist to buy L.A. real estate
without making any down payment whatsoever?  Etc., etc., blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullseye! O.K. Now we've got the list picked out, we've got an idea for a
product and we've got our central selling idea and we are now ready for: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5 - What you do at this point is create your product and here is how you
do it. First you go back to those books on real estate investing and you
extract in outline form all the good ideas in these books. Then you pick out
the best of the ideas and overlay them with the ideas you will have by now come
up with yourself. Next you arrange these ideas in some logical form and you
start writing. Please remember, what we are creating here is a report NOT a
book. I figure it should be something like 100 typewritten pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, please remember this: If you do this properly you will have created
something of considerable value. After all, what you will have done (hopefully)
is taken a few good books on real estate investing and stripped away the
garbage and created a tight informative roadmap to real estate riches. Hey, how
about that? Didn't I tell you that if you just keep flowing that something of
value will emerge? Just look what has just slipped out of my mind! Did you
catch it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazing L.A. Roadmap To Real Estate Riches! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, eh? Now, we've got the title for our report!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kiddo, I don't exactly know what I'm going to write about today so what I
am going to do is just keep putting words down on paper until I start to get
some direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that I need to tell you that just because …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kiddo, I don't exactly know what I'm going to write about today so what I
am going to do is just keep putting words down on paper until I start to get
some direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that I need to tell you that just because I told you how to
pick the very best lists doesn't mean that the less responsive lists are not
valuable. Never forget the coat-of-arms promotion. That was mailed (and very
successfully) to names taken from the white pages of the telephone book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess what I want to start on today is how to think about developing a mail
order campaign. And, as I said earlier, from now on a good part of your working
life should be spent reading the "SRDS" list book and newspapers and magazines
that carry a lot of MO advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, by the way, I jogged the hill 4 times (non-stop) yesterday! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anyway, I myself, have recently been thumbing through the "SRDS" book and
an interesting idea has occurred to me. There is, as you shall see when you
start using the book, a big section devoted to compiled lists. All compiled
lists are, by the way, names and addresses of people or businesses or
institutions or whatever that have something in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: brick layers, architects, chiropractors, churches, businesses who
do a \$500,000 gross every year, business who do \$1,000,000 every year, YMCA's,
police stations, veteran purchasing agents, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K., here's my idea: What if you took the following headline: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How You Can Make Extra Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then you customize it to something like: "How Architects Can Make Extra
Money" or "How Churches Can Make Extra Money" or "How Chiropractors Can Make
Extra Money" etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's say that we hire somebody to write a little report for us. The first
part of the report tells about certain little-known techniques for making and
investing money that anybody can use. The second part of the book would contain
money making techniques that would uniquely apply to a particular group of
people such as architects or chiropractors. (By the way, chiropractors are
greedy so they would be one of my first targets!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, let's say our report is finished and so, now, we write a letter
incorporating the idea that I previously expressed in those sample headlines.
Perhaps the letter would start out like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Charles L. Davidson
1016 Ocean Ave.
Santa Monica, CA 90402 
Dear Dr. Davidson, 
     I am writing to you because I have discovered a great new 
way for doctors of chiropractic to make a great deal of extra
money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really incredible and I am surprised no one has thought of
it before. Here's what it is all about: blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter would, of course, go on to describe the report and ask him to buy a
copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's supposed we sell the report for \$20.00 and let us further suppose
that when we mail our letters we find that we get a very modest 4% response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the numbers. I'm going to stop here a moment and check the "SRDS" and
see how many bone snappers there are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That took 4 minutes. There are more than 33,000 chiropractors we can mail to.
Now, let's figure it will cost us \$400 per thousand (M) to mail out our
letters. That's \$400 per M x 33M or a total mail out cost of \$13,200. Now at a
4% response we will get 1,320 orders. Multiply 1,320 orders times \$20.00 per
order and we will have total sales of \$26,400. When we subtract our mailing
cost of \$13,200 from our sales revenue we have left \$13,200. Now we must also
subtract our cost of filling the orders. Since it shouldn't cost more than
\$4.00 apiece on the outside our total fulfillment cost will be \$4.00 per order
times 1,320 orders or \$5,280.00. When we subtract this figure from the \$13,200
we have left we will be left with a net profit of \$9,920.00. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a fortune but not to be sneezed at either. Especially when you consider
that what I have described is less than 30-days work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if this idea actually works, we have something much more valuable than our
\$9,920.00 profit. Yes indeed, my boy. You see, if this idea works what we have
is a "winning formula"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, my son, what we can do is keep the first section of our report the
same and then customize the last half of the report (it will probably be more
like the last 1/3) for different groups. Then, of course, the first line of our
letter will talk about a great new way for plumbers to make extra money. Or
architects. Or brick layers. Or preachers. Or dentists. Etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucho bucks! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What'dya think of that? Right here before your eyes your old man has, during
his lunch hour, come up with a brand new money maker! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder they call me "The Legend." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, what I have just described seems to me like a good idea and, more
importantly, it helps a little to illustrate, as I said earlier, how to think
about mail order! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also illustrates the important concept of customization. As a general rule,
the more "custom tailored" your promotion is the more successful it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you get a letter in the mail that says: "Dear Occupant,
Here is news about a great new way to make money. Etc., etc., etc." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mildly interesting. But now read this! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, 
     Here is a great new way for 16 year old kids to make money! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah, blah, blah, etc., etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a difference, right? Just imagine that you were to receive such a letter
on or right after June 26. It sure would get your attention much more than the
first letter, wouldn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And notice this: The second letter is not only customized (at is for 16 year
olds) it is also personalized because it refers to you by name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Dear Bond" and the "16 year old kids" part of the letter really zeroes in
on you, doesn't it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of customization. Suppose you were writing an ad about a
book that tells how to buy real estate with no money down. Your headline might
look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Buy Real Estate With No Money Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's boogie. Try this on for size!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Buy L.A. Real Estate With No Money Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better, eh? As a matter of fact I did write an ad for such a book and I
did customize the ad and it did work much better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know this: Ideas breed other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it just occurred to me that in addition to offering chiropractors,
plumbers and so on a customized way to make money, we could also offer them a
customized way to buy real estate. And, in this case, perhaps the first line in
our letter might be: "Dear Doctor X, Here's a unique way L.A. chiropractors can
purchase California real estate with no money down. Etc., etc."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love You and Good Luck &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another digression. I am tired. I was upset after last night's visit plus my
roommate was snoring like a buzzsaw last night.  (Poetic justice) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what should a person do when he is tired? Should he stay on his program
or should he rest? It all depends. I am skipping lunch today and I am writing
this on my lunch hour. If it turns out, that in my opinion, I am just spinning
my wheels, I will stop writing and start resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to my road work which I will start a couple hours from now.
You see, the way I look at it, if you halt your forward progress every time you
get a little tired or irritable or whatever; then you are suffering from a lack
of discipline.  On the other hand, if you keep pushing when you are chronically
tired or really sick, then you are a fool. A lot of men do this because of a
misplaced sense of macho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not macho, it's stupid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I do when, like today, I don't feel like working, is that I start
working anyway and I pay attention to what signals my brain and body is sending
me. Then, after working a while, if I honestly do start to feel worse I will
stop and quit. However, if I just feel a little bit crummy (as I do now) I keep
on plugging along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, "Most of the world's work is done by people who didn't
feel much like getting out of bed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I am having coffee and V-8 Juice. I am a big fan of V-8. It's
cheap, it only has 36 calories, and, when you pour it over a tall glass of ice
cubes it really tastes great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a try. It's a nice alternative once in a while to eating or having a
soft drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to marketing. You know, one of the remarks I hear all the time when I
ask someone what they think of one of my ads goes something like this: "Oh, I'm
not a good person to ask. I never buy anything by mail." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really. Mail order sales run into the billions of dollars each year but rarely
will you run into anyone who admits to being a mail order buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think all these non-mail order buyers are the same people who
don't read the "National Enquirer." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it must be all those Martian invaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am doing here is redundantly making a point and I am going to be even
more redundant. Here's another little glimpse into one of the vagaries of human
behavior: Once I asked at class at USC how many of them preferred to go to
plays more than movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people raised their hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bull!" I said to them. "You are all fooling yourselves and I'm going to prove
it." I then asked for a show of hands of those people who had seen a play in
the last week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then asked to see the hands of people who had seen a movie in the last week
or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond, this phenomena is common. All of us, including thee and me, have a
slightly shrewd idea of ourselves. We often try to convince others and
ourselves that we are something we are not, something we have an idea we
"should" be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, truth, my good son, can be determined NOT by how people use their
mouth but rather how they use their wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to burn this message into your mind. Be skeptical of what people say. Be
skeptical of surveys. Of questionnaires. Instead, believe in numbers. For
example, if everybody you talk with says they like plays more than movies and
yet the numbers say that 10,000 times more people buy movie tickets then you
believe the numbers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - guess what?
It's probably a duck! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So keep reading the "SRDS" book. Keep looking at hot mail order publications
and repeat mail order ads. Get yourself on as many mail order lists as
possible. (Get a P.O. Box.) Watch the offers you receive. Anything you are
going to buy anyway, and you can purchase by mail - do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your finger on the pulse of the industry. Stay aware. Keep awake to the
possibilities of overlooked marketing opportunities. After a while you will
develop a sixth sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a true story that illustrates what I am trying to get across. It has
long been my belief that a lot of money can be made by making offers to people
who are at an emotional turning point in their lives. For example, when they
have just had a baby, just gotten married, just lost a loved one, just gotten a
raise, just filed bankruptcy, just purchased a new car, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, guess what? For a long time I have been wishing there was a way to get a
list of pregnant women. Now there is! While looking through the "SRDS" I
discovered that now you can rent 120,000 new names of pregnant mothers every
month. Oh boy! Well, I got myself a hold of an M.D. who is very skilled in
research in the areas of human and animal intelligence and I have commissioned
him to write a report titled "How To Raise Your Child's IQ Before It Is Even
Born!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exciting. Let's talk numbers. I plan to sell the report for $19.95$2.75
postage and handling. (Total $22.70) My fulfillment costs will probably be
(including the 10% I pay the doctor) about $5.00. This means that every sale
will yield a $15.00 contribution to overhead. Now, let's assume I'll get a 5%
response. This means, of course that out of every 1,000 letters I mail I will
be receiving a total of 50 orders at $22.70 or a total gross income of
$1,135.00. Now let's deduct $5.00 per order for fulfillment (which is $5.00 x
50 orders or $250) from this $1,135.00 and, as you can see we will have $885.00
left.  Now, of course, we must also deduct the cost of the mailing. I figure it
will cost (including list rental) about $400 per M (thousand) to mail a
promotion like this. Thus, when we deduct this $400 from the $885.00 we have
left to play with, you will see that we have a profit of $485.00 for every
thousand letters mailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot damn! I'm cooking now! I'm glad I decided not to rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward. Let's see now $485.00 profit per M times 120M equals a total profit of
$58,200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVERY MONTH! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I'm sitting here with Bobby B and I have just discovered how to get Paul
Harvey on my new radio. What I get is a very weak signal from KABC but, my
other co-worker Jack (The Plantation Nigger) (he's really white) has just
shuffled over.  Jack told me earlier, that you can get Paul also at 2:30. Maybe
I'll interrupt my running and see if I can get him then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You And Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get right back into the subject of becoming a student of markets,
especially mailing lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last letter gave you a beginning insight into what makes a list more
responsive. Let's review a few conclusions we came to based on the data in
yesterday's letter. You will remember, of course, that I said that, as a
general rule, any list of proven mail order buyers will out perform any list of
non-buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as another general rule, there are three main guidelines you can rely on
when you are picking lists to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three guidelines are recency, frequency and unit of sale.  A brief
explanation follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency - The more recently a person has purchased (by mail) something similar
to what you are selling, the more receptive he will be to your offer. Get 'em
while they're hot! In fact, always check to see if the list you are interested
in has "hotline buyers" and see if you can rent them before anybody else.
Hotline buyers are the most recent buyers of all.  Sometimes they will be
90-day hotline buyers or even 30-day hotline buyers. These names are extremely
good prospects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency - The more often a person buys a particular item, the higher his
desire for that type of production service. It just makes sense. If you are
selling a book on skin diving and you can find a list of people who have
purchased several other books on skin diving, then you know he is interested in
the subject and will be a likely prospect to buy your book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit of sale - Once again, we have a guideline that just plain makes sense.
After all, a person who recently paid \$100.00 for a bottle of diet pills is
probably a hotter prospect for diet type products than a person who has only
paid \$10.00 for a bottle of diet pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, Bondo-Dog, people don't always put their money where their mouths
are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires
are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recency, frequency and unit of sale: All good guidelines for evaluation of a
mail order list. And, in my opinion, of the three guidelines, RECENCY is, by
far, the most important of all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's discuss some other ways of finding out what people like to purchase
by mail. In addition to mailing lists, there are a number of so called "hot"
mail order publications. These are the newspapers and magazines that mail order
companies advertise in over and over. You should make it a point to discover
what these publications are and get copies of them and become very familiar
with them. You should pay attention to their editorial content and pay special
attention to the mail order ads they carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a newsletter out of New York City called the "Gallagher Report". This
newsletter covers the world of advertising and once each year they publish a
special edition that lists all of the major magazines and it ranks them by
circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should get a copy of this special issue (ask Eric) and then get copies of
the top 100 magazines and go through them and find out which ones carry a lot
of mail order ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just come in after visiting with you, Kevin, Blade and Z and a
digression at this point might be productive. Z, as I am sure you will agree,
probably feels a certain sense of relief that, because of the circumstances,
she has more or less gotten her own way in regards to her ad. It's really too
bad. Too bad for her! You have just seen an excellent example of why I
generally treat clients with an iron fist. Z pulled this same stunt when she
had her other ads written (by other people) and the ads were miserable
failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were on the street I would have handled this situation in a totally
different way. In fact, after about 5-minutes I would have told her to get lost
and that she either gets out of my face or else she can write her own ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here concerns control. Can you imagine how disastrous it would be if
a patient could tell his surgeon how to do the operation? Or, if an athlete
could tell his coach how to do his job? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on. But isn't it ridiculous! A client pays me big money to
write an ad and then they want to tell me how to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens all the time. But not with me. At least not when I am on the
outside. You see, part of the reason I am in so much demand is that I am so
hard headed. Clients, although they would never admit it, most often feel
relieved with someone who takes a "don't you dare mess with my copy" attitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I couldn't make a scene in the visiting room but you can be sure
that the next time I talk with Z that I am going to quietly but firmly put a
lot of pain in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another illustration of the importance of control. When Blade took me
aside, one of the things he explained to me was that (name deleted) in Vegas
wants to put the commissions into another project and delay paying me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's the thing. (Name deleted) is one of the good guys.  And, sadly,
even the good guys have trouble living up to their agreements when it comes to
money. That's one of the reasons I try to structure my deeds so that I get paid
often. You see, when there is big money involved it is very hard for the
clients to write those checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, what really makes it hard for the client is that he usually believes that
he doesn't need you anymore since he already has the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, there's a lesson here but, also, I'm blowing off steam.  Let's get back to
becoming aware of markets. Right here, what I want to do is encapsulate one of
Halbert's Rules of Marketing Success. It is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell People What They Want To Buy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obvious, so overlooked and so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one thing I haven't mentioned so far is that you want to be on the lookout
for ads and direct mail pieces that you see over and over. What this means is
that whomever is running the ad has hit a nerve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a good way for you to make money is for you to hit that same nerve only do
it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and I know I'm being redundant, the most important thing to do first is to
locate those hot buttons. You don't have to guess. You don't have to wonder.
You don't have to ask people or take surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All You Have To Do Is Observe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe the ads that keep repeating. Observe the size of the mailing lists
available for rental on different product areas.  Observe the direct mail
pieces that keep getting mailed out month after month and sometimes year after
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No messing around. I'm going to dive right back into the subject of becoming a
"student of markets".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, once in a while I give a class on copywriting and/or selling by
mail. One of the questions I like to ask my students is: "If …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No messing around. I'm going to dive right back into the subject of becoming a
"student of markets".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, once in a while I give a class on copywriting and/or selling by
mail. One of the questions I like to ask my students is: "If you and I both
owned a hamburger stand and we were in a contest to see who would sell the most
hamburgers, what advantages would you most like to have on your side?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers vary. Some people say they would like to have the advantage of
having superior meat from which to make their hamburgers. Others say they want
sesame seed buns. Others mention location. Someone usually wants to be able to
offer the lowest prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after my students are finished telling what advantages they would most
like to have I say to them: "O.K., I'll give you every single advantage you
asked for. I, myself, only want one advantage and, if you will give it to me, I
will whip the pants off of all of you when it comes to selling burgers!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What advantage do you want?" they ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only advantage I want," I reply, "is A STARVING CROWD!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to teach you here is to constantly be on the look out for
groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at
least hungry!) for some particular product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you measure this hunger? Well, fortunately, if you are working with
mailing lists, it is rather easy. Let's take an example: Suppose you want to
sell a book on how to invest money and you have created a direct mail promotion
designed to sell this book. Who do you mail your promotion to? Here are some
possibilities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #1 - We could mail it to people whose names and address we get
right out of a telephone book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: This is a terrible idea. There are too many non-prospects in this
kind of group. The only thing in common that people in the phone book have is
that they all have a phone. Some of the people won't have any money to invest.
Some of them never purchase anything by mail. Some of them are too busy (or
uninterested) to even read your letter. Some of them don't even know how to
read! In short there is too much waste circulation. This is like shooting with
a shotgun instead of a rifle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #2 - We could mail our promotion to people whose names and
addresses we get from a phone book but only to those people who live in high
income areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: This is a little better, but not nearly good enough.  High income
areas are, incidentally, easy to identify because several companies have
compiled statistics on every zip code in the United States and they can tell
you with great accuracy the average income per person in each zip code. They
can also, by the way, tell you the average education level; average age, how
much they spend on automobiles and a bunch of other stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I said, this still isn't nearly good enough. For one thing, not
everybody who lives in a high-income area has a high income. Some of these
people might be the maids or gardeners or some other type of servant. (Come to
think of it, I'm not so sure that quite a few gardeners aren't wealthy.) Some
of these people may have money but are not interested in investing. Some of
them may always buy books from a bookstore and never by mail.  Some of these
people can't read English. (There are more and more rich foreigners in our
country.) Some of them may have money to invest but are only interested in
investing in areas in which they already have expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. Once again we are shooting with a shotgun instead of a rifle. Once
again, too much waste circulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see if we can do a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #3 - We could mail our piece to a group of people that we are
relatively sure have above average incomes. Like doctors. Lawyers. Architects.
Top executives. Accountants.  Owners of expensive homes. Owners of Rolls Royce
automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Not bad. We are now getting into areas where we at least have a
chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least we are relatively sure that most of these people have a high enough
income to maybe be interested in investing. Whether they are interested or not,
we can't know, but at least, if they are, they probably have the ability to do
some investing. This group of people is certainly more likely to respond to our
pitch than the first two groups but, as you shall see, we can do a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #4 - We could mail our promotion to a list of upper income people
who are proven mail order buyers. Buyers of what, you ask? Actually, for the
purposes of selling by mail, it is generally true that mail order buyers of
anything are better than almost any group of non-mail order buyers. And, in
this case, we have added the extra qualifications that they must be wealthy
mail order buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Now we are getting down to business. This is the first group I have
described that gives us a reasonable shot at success. Not bad. Not bad at all.
But now, let's stop fooling around and go for the hill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #5 - We could mail our promotion to a group of wealthy people who
have ordered some other investment book by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Bingo! Now we're cooking. What could be better? They are upper
income. They are mail order buyers. And, they have purchased BY MAIL a product
similar to ours. What could be better? This is just about as "hot" of a list as
we can get! Or is it? Actually, it is not. Let's keep trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #6 - We could mail our promotion to a list of wealthy people who
have purchased (by mail) a product similar to ours - several times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Yeah! Now we're cooking! Just imagine. They're MO buyers. They're
wealthy! They've purchased (by mail) a product similar to ours. AND they are
repeat buyers of this type of product. How sweet it is! Can it get any sweeter?
Yes, dear Son, it can! Read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #7 - We could mail our promotion to a list of wealthy people who
have purchased (by mail) a product similar to ours - several times AND WHO HAVE
PAID BIG MONEY FOR WHAT THEY BOUGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Goody. These people are very close to the "crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me" of
lists we can mail to. But wait! Why do I say they are "very close" to the best?
After all, what more could we ask for? Hold on! We're not done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not quite. Just keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #8 - We could mail our promotion to a list of wealthy people who
have purchased (by mail) a product similar to ours - and who have done so
repeatedly - and who have paid big money for what they purchased - AND WHO HAVE
VERY RECENTLY MADE SUCH A PURCHASE! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: This is almost as good a list as we can get. It is certainly the best
list we are likely to be able to rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not quite. Just keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #9 - We could mail our promotion to a list of people who have all
the characteristics of possibility #8 AND WHO OUR FRIENDLY LIST BROKER TELLS US
IS WORKING LIKE CRAZY FOR OTHER MAILERS WITH PROMOTIONS SIMILAR TO OURS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: For a variety of reasons, many lists that should work don't. Who
knows why? It really doesn't matter why. What matters is that a list is or is
not responsive. And the best way to know what lists are hot is to have a good
relationship with a good honest broker. In fact, if you have a good
relationship with a good broker one of the things he will do (because it is to
his financial advantage) is to keep an eye out for hot lists that are likely to
work for your offers. And now, with this last list we have finally and truly
identified the best list you can mail to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. We can still do better! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibility #10 - There is one group of people who will respond even better
than all the other 9 groups I have described. Can you guess what list this will
be? Think about it a minute and then turn the page for the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BEST LIST OF ALL IS YOUR OWN CUSTOMER LIST!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: All other things being equal, your own customers should respond far
better than any other list you can get. Of course there is one caveat. THEY
MUST BE SATISFIED CUSTOMERS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How's my favorite youngest son? I'm sitting here waiting for the phone and I
decided to start writing so let's push forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to get started on the subject of how to make money.
Usually, when someone asks me what is the #1 big secret to making money I tell
them they should get involved in whatever excites them the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good advice. Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often
a by product of enthusiasm. If a person, secretly in his heart, wants to be an
architect, he shouldn't go into selling real estate, for example, just because
he has heard that that is where the money is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is where the enthusiasm is. Please remember this!  Remember it also,
when, in the future, you need to hire someone.  Always look for the most
enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making money, attitude is the most important thing of all.
That's why you are so appreciated at Advanced Management. You have exactly the
kind of attitude that a sharp employer looks for. So remember all this and when
it is your turn to hire someone. Usually, Bond, when I discuss making money
with someone, I spend a lot more time on attitude because it is so important.
But you already have a great attitude so I'll save any further discussion for
later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you already seem to have a natural talent and enthusiasm for direct
marketing so I am going to directly proceed to that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, pay attention. The very first thing you must come to realize is that you
must become a "student of markets". Not products. Not techniques. Not
copywriting. Not how to buy space or whatever. Now, of course, all of these
things are important and you must learn about them, but, the first and the most
important thing you must learn is what people want to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's easy. You see, the way to deduce what people want to buy is to simply
observe what they DO buy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as simple as that. But be careful. You want to know what people actually
DO buy, not what they SAY they buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a true story. Once upon a time a beer company did a survey to find out
which of their products customers preferred and you know what? To their
astonishment they found that 80% or so of the people they surveyed preferred
their premium beer as opposed to their regular beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why were they astonished? The answer is easy. You see, their sales figures were
showing that most people bought their regular beer and NOT the premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on here? Well, for one thing, it is very common.  You see, the
surveyed people were trying to give the "right" answer and so they put down as
an answer the beer they felt they SHOULD DRINK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens all the time. But pity any poor fool who decides to go into the
brewery business based on this kind of erroneous marketing information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of how people struggle to give the "right" answer. How
many people do you know who read the "National Enquirer"? Not many huh? Almost
everybody I talk with really puts down the "Enquirer". (Even here in Boron) But
guess what? The "National Enquirer" is the largest selling newspaper in the
world - BY FAR! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet nobody reads it. At least not here on earth. It must be all those Martians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do people read? I'll bet if you took a survey you would discover that the
most read book of all is the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just not true. Hardly anyone (percentage wise) has actually read the
Bible. A lot of people own a Bible, a lot of people DISPLAY their Bibles, some
people are given to swearing on a Bible but damn-few people have actually READ
the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who can blame them? The Bible is repetitive, hard-to-read and most of it is
deadly boring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet people feel guilty and, in their attempt to give the RIGHT answer, they
will say (and often convince themselves) that the Bible is their favorite
reading material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to know what some people would consider a sickening statistic? Here it
is: MORE PEOPLE READ THE "NATIONAL ENQUIRER" IN ONE SINGLE WEEK THAN HAVE EVER
READ THE BIBLE IN THE LAST 2,000 YEARS! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry. But that's the way it is. And, if you want to be a top notch marketing
man you have to know how it is. How it really is. Not how people (or you) wish
it was or how they think it is.  No. You must become a "student of reality".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find out what people actually buy? And, more particularly, how do
you find out what they buy via direct response? The "SRDS Direct Mail List
Book". Then what you should do is turn to the CONSUMER LISTS section and just
start reading.  It will be quite an adventure. You should pay special attention
to the numbers involved and the descriptions of the lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see if I can find an example. Aha! Here are a few that look very
interesting under section 561 which is the classification for INVESTORS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond And Ruby Buyers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description: Investment counselors, brokers, dealers and individuals who have
purchased diamonds and rubies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;average unit of sale  =  $5,000.00 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantity = 3,979&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Let's think about this for a minute. Here are almost 4,000 people who,
according to this information have spent an average of $5,000.00 to buy
diamonds and rubies. Let's see now... $5,000 apiece times 4,000 buyers equals -
uh 20 MILLION DOLLARS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. What else would they be likely to buy? How about more of the
same? (That's usually a good bet.) Maybe (probably) they'd be receptive to a
hot new diamond offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmn? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Buyers And Enquirers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description: People who purchased or inquired about purchasing diamonds. 60%
buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average unit of sale  =  $5,000.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(always pay special attention to the average unit of sale - the higher the
better!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantity = 52,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do the numbers on this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52,000 x 60% buyers = 31,200 actual buyers... and... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31,200 buyers x $5,000 comes to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot damn! Figures like that will get your greed glands going won't they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Believe it or not, I didn't know about the above lists until just now. I
really and truly turned to them totally by accident. Isn't that something?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 4</title><link href="/chapter-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-15T11:05:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-15T11:05:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-15:/chapter-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very nice for all of you to come up yesterday and bring me a birthday

&lt;p&gt;It was very nice for all of you to come up yesterday and bring me a birthday
cake. It is good to know that you are all on my side and that I have a strong
outside "support system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everybody understood why I wanted to leave before 7:30.  If I hadn't
left when I did I would have missed commissary and I wouldn't have gotten my
supply of fruit for the whole week.  Also, Doc, my best friend in Boron so far,
was leaving the next morning (that's this morning; he's gone now) and I needed
to spend more time with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do appreciate all of you and I just wanted to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward. Let's get back to the subject of physique. As I said yesterday, I
believe the best physique for a man is lean and hard with strong muscular arms
but not a bulging, exaggerated weight-lifter's body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do I stress arm development so much? There are several reasons. As I
said yesterday, one benefit is that it is just plain handy to have a long of
strength in your arms. I also said the kind of body I have been touting is
attractive to women and wins you respect from men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about that respect a little bit. The first thing I want to say is
that a fat, sloppy or skinny and weak body tends to broadcast to the world that
the owner of that body is lacking self-respect. The second thing is that tough
animals have a tendency to prey on weak or helpless animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something to remember: DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR INVITES AGGRESSIVE ACTION! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that means is that in life in general (and in prison in particular) there
is very little sympathy for a weakling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a guy here that I used to like but now he is starting to irritate me.
In many ways he's nice old guy (I'll write more about him later) but he is
serving a miserable 100 day sentence (maybe it's even less) and he shuffles
around like a plantation nigger trying to please "Ol Massah." What's going on
is plain and simple: He's scared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that's no sin. God knows I've been scared many times. But this guy stays
scared when there is no need to be and it is very unattractive to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, don't get the wrong idea and start worrying about this guy.  I am very
nice to him and so is everybody else. Everybody cuts him a lot of slack. This
is a very "soft" place to do your time and all I want to do by describing this
man's mode of behavior to you is to make a point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this: Bond, as you know, I am a very non-violent person and if
this guy, by acting like such a pussy, can irritate me, just think how some
hard vicious hard-nosed jerk in a real prison would be affected by him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, this guy is sending out signals and those signals are saying, "I'm
scared. I'm a pussy. I'm easy. I'm vulnerable." And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, not everybody in the world is kind or sympathetic. Some men
just look for guys like this guy to prey on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, I'm long-winded aren't I? Anyway, finally to get to the point, what I'm
trying to say is that it is far better to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rely On Your Own Strength Instead Of Somebody Else's Compassion!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to make the obvious point, you've obviously first got to have some
strength in order to be able to rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't fake it. At least it's not a good idea. Especially in a prison or
anywhere else where there are "mean streets". You don't need to "act tough";
you need to be tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about being mean or macho or even pushy.
I'm also not talking about pumping iron for hours a day or getting a black belt
in Karate either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to do all that. Plain simple toughness will do.  You see most
predators, when it comes to their victims, are very practical. Let's face it.
If a couple of guys decide to go to the park and mug somebody, they aren't
going to pick on some big gnarly looking guy. No, they will go after the victim
who looks like easy pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? I believe that if you have two guys of the same height and same
weight and you dress them both in a full suit of clothes that most of the time
you will still be able to tell who is the toughest. You see, when you "get
tough" not only does your appearance change; your "signals" change also. The
way you move, the way you hold yourself, your reactions to outside stimuli -
all of that changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want you to start getting tough and self reliant. By the way, I read a
quote by John D. Rockefeller in "The Enquirer" today to the effect that nothing
is as satisfying as self reliance and I totally agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't get confused. I don't want you to become a fighter in the physical
sense as much as I want you to become a "Fight Avoider". And I want you to be
able to avoid fights without losing your dignity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the best ways to avoid fights (I know this sounds kind of silly!) is
to have big arms. Have you ever heard this comment? "Damn! Look at the arms on
that guy! How'd you like to meet him in a dark alley?!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big strong arms. Start developing them right now. There are no drawbacks and
many benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, hopefully, by now now I've got you doing your road work, developing your
arms and eating more or less properly. On that assumption I am going to
temporarily drop this area and start writing about how to make money. We'll
come back to health and fitness later though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tomorrow we'll start on money. However, right now, I want to comment
briefly on one of my friends here. He is black and he was formerly in San
Quentin for shooting two Santa Monica cops because he thought they were trying
to get his supply of dope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's a heroin dealer from Hollywood and he is 55 years old and he is indeed a
"career criminal". He thought she was going to OD from the heroin he had sold
her. He's a fascinating guy and maybe we'll talk about him at another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guy was taken out of his hand cuffs yesterday. They found a bunch of money
and pot in his hobby shop locker. Last night my friend Doc told me a story
about this guy. It seems that some guy snitched on him and his wife and caused
his wife to go to jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anyway, for some reason this guy was in another institution and he was
part of a line of guys who were hand cuffed and in chains when he spots the
snitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does he do? Simple. He grabs a nearby pencil (or pen, I forget) and tries
to ram it into the snitch's brain by stabbing him in the eye. As it turned out,
he didn't kill the snitch, but he did manage to blind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell. It was just "his way".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to sign off now. Are you following my suggestions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:42 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of this letter is again VERY well made and quite clear.
However, a few of the short sentences surrounding the main lesson trigger
memories of other lessons and amazing facts about my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning seems like a simple "sorry for cutting everything so short
last time" sentence to his family and it was, but it is also a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, you can see how nothing stood in the way of what Gary felt was
important to his life and routine. He really did prioritize well. Even these
letters to me start with health first and then get into what he alone could
teach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point is his appreciation for a good support system. Everyone
knows a good support system can be REALLY helpful. Look at men of average
skills who attain lofty positions for no better reason than their support
system. But my dad had a rare and enviable skill of eradicating people from his
life if they were not a positive influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have people in our lives we are stuck dealing with for a variety
of reasons such as loyalty based on past friendship, family or some other sense
of duty. Well not my pop.  He said SCREW THAT and cut anyone who impeded his
enjoyment right out of his life for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn't mean, but he just wouldn't put up with nonsense from ANYONE!
My brother Kevin is like that and I try to learn from them because it makes a
lot of difference to one's success.  Imagine if everyone you deal with is
really on your side and not only believes in you, but they all also want to
seriously help you accomplish your goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people think the hard part is finding positive people, but that
isn't true. Go to any learning Annex workshop with Trump speaking and you will
find positive people with hope.  No, the real trick is to cut out those that
hold you back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to try and hold my dad back was his own father. On
several occasions he told me of how my grandfather told him he wouldn't be able
to breakout of the average working Joe's existence. He had such a lack of faith
in my pop that when he actually did strike it rich, he wouldn't believe it
until my dad showed him mailbags full of checks from people wanting to buy from
him. This was after he bought a new custom home and a built a huge business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my dad stopped seeking his father's approval, he realized he was in
control of his own destiny and without being malicious, he started to rid
himself of the people that held him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sent some money to his mom whenever she needed anything, but for the
most part we moved to California and my grandparents became a much smaller part
of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even wrote about this in "The Dark Side Of Success"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would never want me to tarnish the name of anyone in the family by
citing examples, but suffice it to say that he had the ability and more
importantly the WILL to eliminate or marginalize anyone in his life that he
felt was too negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us like to think we would do the same, but we always have an
excuse. So and so is my in-law so I can't tell him to piss up a rope or we have
been friends since high school.  Screw that. And never ever encourage people
who drag you down to hang around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A support system is like a garden and you always need to be on the
lookout for weeds to pull. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other lesson in this chapter is don't be or appear to be a weak
target. He discusses having large arms as a deterrent and he is 100% right.
Right around the time before he went to prison a friend of mine commented that
he wouldn't mess with my dad. The comment struck me as odd because I saw my dad
as one big loveable guy of average height and my friend had just kicked his
mom's boyfriend's ass about a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him why he thought so and his answer was "his arms". His arms
weren't huge like a body builder, but you could tell they were strong. Proving
the point my dad would later be making in this fourth letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business my father tried to never appear weak and it is easier to not
appear weak when you are strong. If he found out someone was charging more for
an ad he raised his price. He was the best and he was putting it out there.
Carry yourself with confidence (not arrogance) in everything you do and people
will respond to it in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ends the letter with a quote by Rockefeller that self reliance is the
most satisfying thing in the world and it is important to know that often
self-reliance is the real motive of great business men and not money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 3</title><link href="/chapter-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-14T15:26:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-14T15:26:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-14:/chapter-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I jogged "The Hill" two times without stopping! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big deal, huh? Well, it is to me. Your old man is getting lean and mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's get started. First of all, I want to briefly review what I have
suggested to you so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I jogged "The Hill" two times without stopping! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big deal, huh? Well, it is to me. Your old man is getting lean and mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's get started. First of all, I want to briefly review what I have
suggested to you so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.I have suggested that you do one hour's worth of road work every morning
right after you get up for six days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.I have suggested you eat three pieces of fruit every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.I have suggested you eat a large bowl of some bran type cereal every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go from there. What else should your daily diet consist of? Well,
for one thing, you should eat a lot of vegetables. What I suggest is that you
get yourself some kind of baggie or plastic container and every night before
you go to sleep I suggest you cut up a bunch of new veggies and put them in the
container and then put the container in the refrigerator. Then, in the morning,
when you are ready to leave the house, you can grab your raw veggies and take
them with you to munch on them all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, don't listen to all that garbage that says you should not eat
between meals. You should eat between meals. In fact, six small meals is a lot
better than three big ones. Actually, what is best is to have a little nibble
whenever you get hungry. And this is a good way to eat your vegetables. Just
carry your container with you wherever you go and eat some whenever you get
hungry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is a habit that will go a long way in keeping you from
feeling tired because it will tend to keep your blood sugar level at a more or
less constant level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING! Don't depend on your mother or anybody else to buy or cut up your
vegetables for you. You should, instead, develop a tough independent attitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, when you depend on others you give yourself an excuse for failure.
"It's not my fault if she forgot to buy my vegetables." And so on. Don't set
yourself up like this. Depend on yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K. So far, we've got you eating fruit, vegetables and a bran type cereal.
What else? Well, one thing else I think you should do is drink one large glass
of non-fat milk every day. This will give you your calcium, some protein and
some other good stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, what else? More protein, of course. As I said, you'll get some protein
from your milk but it won't be nearly enough. You should also have at least one
serving of some kind of lean meat or fowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburgers are fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go easy on eggs. Two or three a week is plenty. They contain a lot of
cholesterol and that's the stuff (along with fats) that can clog up your
arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a couple more good ideas. (1) Buy yourself a box of bran flakes and mix
two or three heaping tablespoons full into your cereal or whatever. (2) Get
some protein powder. You can get this at most any health food store and I now
believe it is a good idea (especially for a growing boy) to add some protein
powder to his diet every day as "protein insurance." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else should you eat? Actually, just about anything you want. I think it is
a bad idea to ever forbid yourself to ever have ice cream or a soft drink or
whatever. Just go easy and use a little common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't worry. You see, if you keep up your road work and eat all the foods
you should eat every day you won't have much room (or much inclination) to load
yourself up with junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a break. I'm going to stop writing in a minute or two anyway because
it is time for mail call. You know, Bondo, I've been thinking. I figure it will
take me about one hundred letters to teach you the basics of what I want you to
know. This should come out to between 500 to 1,000 legal pages of writing and
these pages will form the core or nucleus of the book I want to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I get this first part done I intend to take notes from various good books
on exercise, diet, selling by mail, etc. and then, at this point, I should be
able to sit down with all these letters and notes and then outline the book I
want to write. After that, I'll write the first draft of the book. Then, after
that, I'll review everything all over again and then write the final draft. I
figure my timetable for the book to work out roughly like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letters to Bond .................. 3-months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes from other books ........... 2-months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline .......................... 1-month (maximum) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First draft ...................... 2-months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final draft ...................... 1-1/2 months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish ........................... 1-1/2 months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total ... 11-MONTHS &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember - these are very rough estimates. Actually, it is my goal to have the
book finished after about ten-months of solid work which means I should
(hopefully) be done by middle of next April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see. But one thing is true. This is the best place to write and get
healthy I've ever been. I seem to get more productive every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, I'll have to commit some new federal crime every couple of years in
order to get my books done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. Just kidding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange. We usually have the mail by now but today it is late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I'll just keep waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was interrupted by mail call and now they are having "count." Count is simply
when they count us to make sure we are all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do this often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. I was about to say let's get back to business. Now that I have
(hopefully) got you doing your morning road work and eating more or less
properly, I want to talk about other exercise in addition to road work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I don't think I have to say a lot right now because you are probably
doing just fine at Questar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I keep saying, I'm just warming up right now and I'll cover exercise in more
detail later. But anyway, right now, I just want to say that I want you to
concentrate on developing your arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you really have to do are presses and curls. You know, I don't think it is
desirable to have a body builder's body. Women, in general, are not attracted
to to the exaggerated development of body builders and I personally don't like
this type of physique either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a man looks best (and I think most women would agree with me) when he
is lean an hard - not bulging and overdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do think it is a good idea to spend enough time to develop strong
muscular arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for this. First, of all, it is useful to be strong.
Secondly, I think women are attracted to lean, hard men with strong muscular
arms. And, thirdly, from a prison point of view, just having big arms can keep
you out of a lot of trouble and I'll discuss this in more detail tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye for now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVE YOU AND GOOD LUCK!           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This third letter seems to cover only health suggestions, but there
are also two non-health related lessons to be learned and one is in no way
evident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice on health and working out is again very good and I agree
with it so there is very little to add to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part where he tells me not to rely on anyone is a whole lesson
all by itself. By this point you can see he had a healthy disdain for the
mindset of regular people and that is indeed a positive attribute especially
when it comes to making money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most people tell others of any plan to make money, they are
met with instant negativity. They will tell you it can’t be done, it isn’t
worth it or remind you of all the pitfalls they can think of. I don’t care what
you think of your friends or family, it is in their nature to stop you. Don’t
get the idea that this is in everything you attempt, just when you attempt to
do things on a scale so grand that if successful, you will be a whole lot
richer than them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t do this consciously. They simply need to do it to make
themselves feel better. Yes that is right, to most people the very idea of you
getting rich makes them sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose you come up with the idea to open the first biodeisel
fuel station in Barstow, the small town almost exactly half way between Los
Angeles and Las Vegas. As you begin to explain how you can obtain financing and
get equipment, they will immediately tell you how regulation and property
prices are obstacles. They will say these problems are insurmountable and are
too hard to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One logical assumption is that people do this because they
obviously are people with a CAN’T do attitude, but that doesn’t explain people
who own their own businesses putting the ideas down and they often do. I think
it is because when you tell people your plans to get rich, they will translate
your success into their failure for not becoming rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, most people judge how well they have done in life by
comparing themselves to their peers and if one of their peers has become a
multi millionaire and could retire young and rich, then they will have to
question their own choices. It is ironic that so many people say they want to
be rich yet put down almost everyone who tries and often they put down those
that do succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an irrational hatred of the rich and it is born out of
spite. Terms like “filthy rich” and “born with a silver spoon in the mouth” are
not compliments. You can worry about that when you are rich, but for now you
need to worry about all those people who want to stop you from becoming rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember where they are coming from and try to surround
yourself with people who have similar goals or who have already become great
successes. These people are almost always hungry for people to appreciate what
they have accomplished and more than the size of their bank account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who thinks their friends and family will support them no
matter what their goal is, tell them you plan to open a restaurant. They will
tell you more than 90% of new restaurants fail within one minute. They will
never say, “a lot dumber people than you have opened great restaurants so go
for it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice that almost everyone knows that stat yet can’t quote
current money market returns? Our schools teach people how to work within
businesses, but never how to start a business. Is it better to teach your kids
how to change oil in the car or how to write an ad to bring in business? It is
almost as if we have all been trained to accept capitalism, but only as part of
the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it is vital that you never let the bastards get you down
and in this case the bastards are almost everyone you meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point which I feel can be made now is that he repeats
himself often. This is not absent mindedness and is 100% intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is much like the one in the previous letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely accepted and both my dad and I agreed that one of the
best business books in the world is “The Godfather.” My dad often remarked on
how he loved the book and film. One of his favorite lessons in the book was
when the Godfather explains to his youngest son Michael that he must continue
to think about and go over their plans for the future. In the scene Brando say
to Pacino, “I hope you don’t mind me going over this Barzini business” and then
explains he does it to avoid being careless. Going over and over plans is a
good way to make sure everyone is on the same page and to remember small
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people write down their goals and go over them everyday. This
amounts to the same thing and is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum it up the two lessons are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage over others is great when one can shut out the negative
attitude of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners revise their plans over and over and constantly reassess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two is often taught in the military. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 2</title><link href="/chapter-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-13T18:57:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-13T18:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-13:/chapter-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I crossed some sort of invisible mental line. It happened 
when I went for my initial meeting with the people who run the camp 
here and found out that they are total jerks. What happened as a
result of that is that instead of being down and depressed I just got 
tougher. Perhaps I'll write more about my new "get tough" attitude in 
a later letter but for now I want to get right back to this road work 
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Bond, I can't stress how strong I feel that doing an 
hour's worth of road work is perhaps the number one most valuable 
habit you can cultivate. You see, if you start your day this way, it
will get you off to a great start and vastly improve the rest of your 
day since it will drain off a lot of tension and anxiety and, in
general, it will clear out your mind so you can think better all day
long! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, after you get into it, it will make you feel great! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, here are some other good health habits that I think you
should get into right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FASTING - You are, in my opinion, too young to go on any extended 
fasts but I really think it would be good for you to fast one (1) 
full day each week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am fasting every Saturday. And, I intend to keep 
fasting one day a week (at least) for the rest of my life. When you 
fast, you begin to normalize your body functions and also, you
develop a certain self-discipline that will help you in most other
areas of your life. I intend to write a lot more about fasting later
on but, for right now, I just want to encourage you to begin
immediately to fast one day every week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips. First of all, I suggest you do not tell other 
people what you are doing. Most people don't understand fasting and 
all you will get from them on this subject is a lot of ignorant 
babble. Secondly, I feel that you should do very little (or no) 
athletic exercise on the days that you fast. You see, your "Fast Day" 
is the day you set aside to give your mind and body a rest. You don't 
have to stay in bed all day or anything like that but you really
should take it easy both physically AND mentally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do on my fast days is sort of kick back and read and putter
around and, also, I have found it a good time to take care of those 
nagging little chores and errands that seem to accumulate during the
rest of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I think you should do road work every morning to
more or less "order your day" and fast every week in order to "order
your week". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what, Son? I am 46 years and one day old and the two 
things I have written to you about so far are the most important
things I have ever learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just think. You can start right now before you are even 16
years old. God, what a head start you will have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go on. The next thing I want to talk to you about is 
your diet. First of all, I believe that everybody who says breakfast
is the most important meal of the day is dead wrong. In my opinion
all you should eat before lunch is a couple pieces of fruit. Do you 
remember what I said to you in yesterday's letter? I said you should
eat a piece of fruit (preferably a banana) before you start your road 
work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after your road work, in my judgement, what you should do is
take a shower, clean up, and get dressed and get your day started.
And then, some time after that, before lunch, you should eat another
piece of fruit. Actually, you should eat three pieces of fruit every
day (except when you fast) and I think you can't miss with a banana,
an apple or an orange. This way, you will get your potassium, your
vitamin (and something called pectin, all of which is very good for 
you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I have read, and I believe it to be true, that fruit
is the prize food of man. Also, I believe that fruit is perhaps the 
number one food category that Americans need to eat more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch your Mom. Watch other people. How much fruit do they eat? 
Very little I'll bet, and they are missing out on something very, 
very important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason, of course, is that fruit contains a lot of stuff that 
is good for you and, another reason is fruit, along with certain
other foods, acts sort of like "nature's broom" and helps keep you
cleaned out and mobilating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I said yesterday, I'm just warming up right now and I
intend to write more on all this at a later date. But for now, it 
would be an excellent idea if you would start eating three pieces of
fruit everyday and start right after you get this letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Bond, in addition to everything else, you are the best 
student I have ever had and it is a real joy to teach all these 
things to you. Boy I sure wish my Dad had been able to do this for me 
but that's water over the dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe we can start a tradition here. A new "Halbert Tradition"
whereupon the father's make it a point to pass down what they have
learned to teach a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here's more info on the subject of diet. What else should you 
eat? Well, one thing is sure: You should definitely eat a big bowl of 
some "bran type" cereal. Grapenuts is probably the best you can find
in an ordinary grocery store and some health food stores have cereals 
that are even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, remember yesterday when I asked you to get a copy of
"The Joy Of Running"? Well, here are two other books you should look
for: "The Miracle of Fasting" by Paul Bragg and "Are You Confused?" 
by Paulo Airola. Many health food stores will probably carry both of
these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don't want you to feel like you have to write to me 
as much as I am writing to you. I do want to hear from you (and 
often) but you are not writing a book like I am so no guilt trips are 
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a break and talk about something else. There's an old
tomcat around here at the camp named Crackers. Crackers is an 
arrogant cat. There is a lot of small game around here and Crackers 
like to catch these little critters and plays with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a week or so ago, I was doing my morning road work and 
I spotted Crackers as I was coming down the backside of "The Hill". 
Crackers had a little critter in his mouth that looks just like a 
baby chipmunk. These little guys are cute as hell and I have since
(I'm getting tired) found out that they are, in reality, Antelope 
Ground Squirrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Crackers had this cute little creature in his mouth and he
brought it over to me and then dropped it. The critter just laid
there. Then, after a little while, Crackers would bat it around a 
little with his front paws. After a while, the critter began to stir
and then it tried to run away. Crackers caught it again in short
order and began to repeat the whole process. What I mean is that he 
would carry it in his mouth and then drop it and then torment it
until finally the poor thing had no fight left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Crackers just messed with this little squirrel
until he tormented the life out of it. And then, after all this, do 
you know what else he would do? What he would do is pick up the 
squirrel again in his mouth and toss his head back and throw it up in 
the air and then bat it back and forth while it was in the air like 
he was playing handball with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever. In any case, when I told some other inmate about this he
said, "Yeah, but that stupid Crackers is nothing but a stupid punk. 
He always takes trash from the other cats around here. There's a
black cat from over at the housing area that whips him all the time!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the point of all this? Probably, there isn't one but it
reminds me of something I read once in an article in "The Herald
Examiner" in which someone was quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is no justice. There is only power." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second letter, pop begins by remarking on his new get-tough 
attitude and with all due respect, that is total bull. He was ALWAYS
tough. I have no illusions about my father and he was not tough in
all situations and certainly had his fears as we all do, but in 
general he has always been tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grew up in an economically depressed small town, served as an MP 
in Germany and had five children by the time he was thirty. He got
rich, went broke, got rich and blew it all again several times by 
this point in his life and squarely faced going to prison head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh he carried fear for sure, but he always did what he had to and he
faced some tough shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden point he might make if he re-read the letter today might 
be how he hates mean people. Mean people and cruelty were something 
he hated to his core and once he knew someone was scum, he developed
a hard-core tough attitude towards that person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important survival skill for him and I. In life everyone
must learn to deal with unnecessary grief from other people, but
sometimes you are faced with a jerk with the balance of power in
their favor and the only way to survive, especially with your pride 
intact, is to develop a mental toughness as a form of mental armor
and it, once you do it, is always there when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who ran Boron didn’t inspire a new get-tough attitude in 
him. No, they simply inspired his toughness to surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of fasting, I did do it a few times shortly after
receiving the letter, but I hate fasting. I never felt good after 
fasting and remember counting the last hours waiting until I could
eat again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was him and his letters that inspired me to eat more fruit than
most other people of my generation and all of his nutritional advice
in the letters is spot on. After he passed, the medical examiner
remarked that he was in great shape, other than being dead of course. 
He would have loved that comment. Seriously though she did say he was 
in terrific shape other than his blocked artery and enlarged heart
that seems to be hereditary in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get far from the subject of fasting, he made what I believe 
to be the most overlooked lesson of the letter and that was when he 
wrote, “don’t tell anyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad’s favorite saying was “nothing is impossible for a man who 
refuses to listen to reason” and it served him well his whole life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did so many things that other people said couldn’t be done. This 
shouldn’t be an altruism where you never ever listen to reasonable
people, but just because someone says you can’t do something or 
shouldn’t, doesn’t mean they are right, even if the whole world 
agrees with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the world are nay sayers. They say it is too
hard to quit smoking or it is too tough to get rich or you will never 
make it. When it comes to accomplishing things, others fail to even 
try. There is no benefit in dealing with people who have nothing but
negative things to say. When that someone amounts to just about 
everyone, just keep it to yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of the Australian doctor who discovered a 
non-surgical cure for ulcers. Everyone in the scientific community
agreed that no viruses or anything could live in the acidic 
conditions inside the human stomach. He spent a LOT of time trying to 
convince other doctors he was right. Finally, he ignored all of them
and went about his research and proved that most ulcers are caused by 
organisms in the stomach. He actually had to treat and cure several 
people before the medical community would even pay attention to him.
But he sure would have saved a lot of time by not bothering to argue
and just finishing his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people KNEW the world was flat and the sun revolved around it,
and what happened when people offered up a different idea? They were
punished for heresy and ridiculed by their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, sometimes there is no use wasting time and energy fighting
established beliefs by arguing and it is better to just silently go 
about proving or accomplishing your goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this letter, he touches briefly on the idea that I would continue
to pass on and add any wisdom to my kids’ early development. This was 
written 15 years before my first child Emma Rose was born. Other than 
in this letter I don’t recall him ever talking about me writing 
letters until one day I told him what I was doing. . He was very
proud that I decided to write letters to my kids and that I was so
appreciative of what he had done for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious that each generation should do better than the
next, but these days that seems to mean money and opportunity alone.
Very few people truly teach their kids anything at all and when they
do it is usually something many others could teach, like sports or
how to drive, but very few teach their kids what schools can’t, 
namely, to think outside the box, to have confidence, to move and not 
to fear mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway the last part of the letter is about Crackers. I remember
Crackers and he didn’t strike me as any more smug than most house 
cats, but pop really liked the ground squirrels and he hated any form 
of cruelty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 46 years he lived before this letter, he had grown up in an
economically depressed town, was a Military Policeman in the Army,
stationed in Germany. He had fathered 5 kids and was divorced twice.
He had also been wealthy and broke several times so it is easy to see 
how the line, “there is no justice, only power” really resonated with 
him at that moment while sitting in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck by this point in time it resonated with me too. Maybe because I
was in the prison-like Los Angeles public school system or because my 
dad was in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let me leave you with the impression I think my dad never did 
anything wrong.  Even he admitted he had gotten away with a lot of
things. Things maybe he should have gone to jail for like drunk 
driving and that is how he was able to cope with being locked up, by
looking at the bigger picture and not just this one travesty of 
justice in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father never ran an ad with the intention to not 
fulfill. He was however very capable of dropping the ball and going 
to lunch instead of watching his business. He had run several 
promotions before and after and not once did anyone ever hear him 
plan to cash checks and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never heard him bother to explain that to people and
somehow nobody ever cared that he did go to prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was very capable of moving on. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry><entry><title>Chapter 1</title><link href="/chapter-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1984-06-12T17:41:00+01:00</published><updated>1984-06-12T17:41:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,1984-06-12:/chapter-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter is going to be the first in a long series of letters in which I
will attempt to communicate to you a lot of the important things I have learned
in the last 46 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to try to teach you what I have …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Bond,   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter is going to be the first in a long series of letters in which I
will attempt to communicate to you a lot of the important things I have learned
in the last 46 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to try to teach you what I have learned about selling by mail,
getting and staying healthy, how to get along with people, and, in general, how
to have a good life without getting yourself all screwed up. There will also be
stuff about sex, drugs and rock and roll! I'm going to try to write to you
every day of the week (except Sunday) and spend about one hour on each letter.
That way, by the time I get out of here we should have covered a lot of ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I intend to reread these letters myself after I am finished and use
them as source material for a book I have wanted to write for a long time. The
book, unless I come up with a better title, will be called:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Be Your Own Messiah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These letters will ramble around somewhat. I'm going to try to keep the flow
going so I am not going to slow down to edit these letters and, therefore,
don't expect them to be as precisely written as my ads and other writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's get started. As you know, today is my birthday and, strange as
it may seem, it hasn't been a bad one under the circumstances. For one thing I
got your birthday letter and the cards your Mom sent me and, for another, today
is the first day I was able to run "the hill" non-stop. Being able to do that
really made me feel good. The hill is a real son of a gun. It is very steep
and, by my calculations, it is about 8/10 of a mile. I went around the hill 5
times for a total of 4 miles and, as I said, on one of those circuits (the
third one), I did it running (actually it was more of a slow jog) non-stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? When I came in here, just three weeks ago, it was hard for me
just to walk once around that darn hill. And, before I am finished, I'll bet
you I can run around that hill ten times (8 miles) without stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anyway, this all leads me to the first and most important thing I want
to write about which is improving and maintaining your health and physical
fitness. I'll have a lot more to say about this subject later but today I just
want to "warm up" a little bit and tell you a few good ideas that you can start
using everyday.   The first thing I want to talk about is "road work". Road
work is walking, jogging and running. And, in my opinion, you should do about
one hour of road work everyday of the week except Sunday. I believe the best
time to do your road work is right after you get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in my opinion, the best groove to get into is get out of bed,
(early) wash your face, brush your teeth, use the bathroom, etc., and then, eat
a piece of fruit (I think a banana is the best) and then hit the street!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. Just get out that front door and start moving. Walk, run, jog.
Keep moving for about 1/2 hour and then turn around and come back. You know, I
really do believe this is the very best way in the world to start the day. It
cleans you out, it settles you down and it gives you a nice glow that will stay
with you throughout the day. It will also make you more clearheaded and improve
the quality of your thinking. The benefits are enormous and, believe me, if you
start doing this right away (like the day after you get this letter!) it won't
be long at all till you become positively addicted to your early morning
workout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, this addiction is not just psychological. It is a real
honest-to-God drug addiction. But don't let that scare you. This is what's
known as a positive addiction. A positive addiction is simply being addicted to
something (like exercise) that improves the quality of your life. A negative
addiction, on the other hand, is being addicted to something (like cigarettes)
that lowers the quality of your life.   What happens when you do road work is
that, after about forty minutes, your brain begins to secrete what some people
refer to as "survival chemicals". The names of these chemicals, as far as I
know, are beta endorphins and norephinphrine. Some people say these chemicals
are 200 times stronger than morphine and, in my opinion, the feeling you get is
sort of like a good drug high except that the "high" is not artificial and you
become zestful rather than speedy and, unlike a drug high, this is a high that
is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I seem to be going on and on about this it is because it is so important
and it is something you can do right away!   And, actually, of everything I
have learned about in my entire life, this stuff about doing road work the
first thing in the morning is very close to being the most important thing of
all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I really hope you get started on this morning road work program as soon as
you get this letter and I also hope it becomes a habit for all the rest of your
life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love You and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Please get me a copy of "The Joy of Running" by Theodore Kostrubala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it. You've just read Chapter 1 of "The Boron Letters".   Chapter
2 will follow in a few short days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. You want to do some of your friends a favor? Have them read my book "The
Boron Letters"... even if... they are not interested in marketing. Why? Because
this book also deals with life... and... they will be able to benefit from
these experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first letter is short yet contains far more than the reader probably
sees and I would wager, that this first letter is most over looked or taken for
granted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson on health he is teaching is crystal clear and it is not lost on
me that he chose this topic first. His father died at the young age of 59 of
heart failure and that spooked him just as my father's death has spooked me. He
did live ten years longer than his dad and it wasn't due to modern medicine by
any means. He was very hard on his body until he was middle age, but then he
would fall in and out of work out phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he was running up to 13 miles on the beach and ate only health
food. Unfortunately he had an arterial blockage that caused his death, but the
ME confirmed that other than that he was in great shape for his age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did try jogging and never liked it. The time it takes to get the
endorphins running to the brain to make you feel high takes too long for me. 
It is also too hard on my knees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all love the high or endorphin rush we get from exercising for a long
time and we all love that calm mellow glow we have when we are done, but I
don't look forward to the process of getting to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, exercise should be fun from the get go and not a WORK out simply
because if it is fun and therefore easier to find the motivation to do it and
keep doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer non-competitive sports instead. There is very little equipment in
sport chalet that I have not tried at one time or another and the only activity
that really stuck with me is bicycling.  It is easier for me because when I
ride, it feels like exploring and not so much like exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he wrote the first letter, I was 15 and at that age all young men
think they are invincible to what ails old people. I knew I would have to take
better care of myself, but I thought it was something for later in life. It
reminds me of a line in a song on the Faces album. “I wish that I knew what I
know now when I was younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that song always reminds me of my pop. I imagine him telling my
son about women's ways (and then me correcting him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there is a lesson he didn't outright express in this first part of
the letter. When he talks about how when he first got there it was hard just to
walk around the hill and very soon he was running up it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got my first mountain bike I decided to ride it to Mullhulland Dr.
and basically that was a three-mile road that varied from around 3 degrees to
at least 45 degrees in some spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day I went to conquer the hill I made it a whopping 1/8th of a
mile. I decided to try again the next day only this time I vowed to get off and
walk if I had to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I took it slower and knowing this was going to be tough, I
decided to try and peddle in a gear that seemed too easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I am sure you can guess the end of this story. Yes I made it all the
way up on my second attempt and the moral isn't just to not give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of my dad's workout story and mine is the same and it applies to
all of life. Try things at least twice. Just the second attempt at anything
hard will be much easier. Not a little bit but by A LOT. It is true of almost
everything, not just sports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All first attempts are sloppy and lame. Most people will quit after their
first experience with things that don't go so well, but if you are like my pop
and I, then you KNOW that the first attempt is almost destined to fail and you
will learn enough to get a better assessment of the whole picture and what it
will really takes to attain a goal on your second attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just that much more ambition will propel you ahead of 95% of everyone
walking the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad part is, we all already know this lesson, but we have to remind
ourselves of it. Anyone who ever learned to ride a bike remembers their first
attempt to learn because it ended with blood.  Oops, anyone old enough not to
have the advantage of today's protective gear that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people get older they start to decide whether they like stuff based on
their first experience. Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks simply
because, if he doesn't get it the first time he gives
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to climb the mountain, but the big difference between those
at the top and those still on the bottom is simply a matter of showing up
tomorrow to give it just one more shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other lesson he touches on is getting up early to do road work and that
too has a business lesson and a VERY important lesson as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he wrote about this in his newsletter, but he used to teach people
something I called “the four square lesson on life”. It was something he picked
up from a great book called “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” by
Stephen Covey. It is a great lesson and relates to the one in the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is this. Everything you do can be categorized as either
important or not important. Also everything you do can be categorized as urgent
or not urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easy to explain we will use a 4 square box: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| |URGENT |NOT URGENT
|-------------:|:-------:|:-----------:
|Important |Q1 |Q2
|--------------|---------|------------- 
|Not Important |Q3 |Q4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the chart is divided into fourths or quartiles, which is
what the Q is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically things that are found in Q1 are urgent and important and would be
things like getting a broken arm fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are urgent but not important would be things like getting to
the toy store before it closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all decide what is important to each of us, but for the most part what
is important but not urgent are things such as working out or getting a
prostate exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final category is hardly worth mentioning because it is neither urgent
nor important and it has things like reading a classic novel. You do them if
you want to, but if not, it doesn't matter at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all spend much of our day taking care of what falls into Q1 and then Q3.
Later, if there is time left over and depending on our mood we will relax and
do things that would fall into Q4 or maybe even take the time to do some of the
things in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners in life and successful people spend a lot more time doing things
that fall into Q2 than most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the time to think about it, everything you do in Q2 helps avoid
having to do so much in Q1. If you spend a lot of time working out you should
spend less time at the doctor's office. If you take care of things that are
important before they become urgent, then the only things that become urgent
will be beyond your control or unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the letter he talks about getting it done early because he
knows that it is something that falls into Q2. The point is we all have to deal
with what is important and urgent. However, early in the morning is the only
time most of us can avoid dealing with regular chores long enough to take care
of things categorized in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the world wakes up and the e-mail messages, text messages and phone
calls start your time will quickly get consumed with things that are urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is the same for business. Take care of important things first and
early before you lose the chance. If you have a marketing campaign to test, the
earlier the better. If you are writing copy for an ad, do it early before the
phone starts ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to guess, I'd say 90% of all successful people get up early and
most of the other ten percent stay up late for the same reason. While everyone
sleeps or watches the boob tube they can get stuff done without being
interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="boron-letters"></category></entry></feed>
