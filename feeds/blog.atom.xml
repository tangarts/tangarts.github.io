&lt;p&gt;I asked Lotaria if she has already read some books of mine that I lent her. She
said no, because here she doesn't have a computer at her disposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained to me that a suitably programmed computer can read a novel in a
few minutes and record the list of all the words contained in the text, in
order of frequency. 'That way I can have an already completed reading at hand,"
Lotaria says, "with an incalculable saving of time. What is the reading of a
text, in fact, except the recording of certain thematic recurrences, certain
insistences of forms and meanings? An electronic reading supplies me with a
list of the frequencies, which I have only to glance at to form an idea of the
problems the book suggests to my critical study. Naturally, at the highest
frequencies the list records countless articles, pronouns, particles, but I
don't pay them any attention. I head straight for the words richest in meaning;
they can give me a fairly precise notion of the book." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a novel of fifty to a hundred thousand words," she said to me, "I advise
you to observe immediately the words that are repeated about twenty times. Look
here. Words that appear nineteen times: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;princesses, frog, miser, juniper, doctor, salad, gardener,
watch, tail, singing, drank, journey, stretched, pulled,
scarcely, legs, stones, bad, rolled, middle, crept, laughed,
vain, glad, cock, broke, grieved, show, horses, tried,
having, cart, waiting, words, cottage, kept, dress, alive,
peas ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Words that appear eighteen times: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dancing, catherine, ashputtel, apples, clock, noise, thither,
bottom, making, mouth, please, meantime, ought, farther, deep,
girls, times, spot, strange, being, knife, lifted, carter,
someone, showed, running, marry, falada, waited, learnt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't you already have a clear idea what it's about?" Lotaria says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's no question: it's a collection of fairy tales, princesses, cottages, 
adventurous prose with a elements of darkness. The narration is entirely on the
surface, I would say; but to make sure, it's always a good idea to take a look
at the list of words used only once, though no less important for that. Take
this sequence, for example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;readily, patience, straightening, leap, sixteenth, irons,
drowned, secret, dozing, comfortably, crawling, tittered,
adjourn, impertinent, worry, rises, handwriting, raw, pulling,
prove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, that seems consistent with what I suggested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lotaria shows me another series of lists. "This is an entirely different novel.
It's immediately obvious. Look at the words that recur about fifty times: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you think of that? An book of betrayal, power struggle, indecisiveness
and uncertainty ... As a confirmation, we'll take a sample of words used
a single time: &lt;/p&gt;

imaginary, consisted, standstill, perceiving, seventh, beatrice,
pressure, definiendis, colleoni, tales, essex, antico,

&lt;p&gt;"I would say we're dealing with a lighter story of deception but this time
a thief. Rhythmic twists and turns, gentlemen, a hidden romance. One last time,
let's look at the list of words with a frequency of one. Look, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

excluded, aquiline, unheard, reward, dealer, improve, differed,
reassure, mason, poker, instantly, trap, plans&lt;/p&gt;

inquiry can start with that, establish some working hypotheses.... What did I

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two classes of data &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_2\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponding to genuine
and counterfeit currency distributed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_j(\mathbf x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j = \{1, 2\}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Letting
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; denote classes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y = 1\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y = 2\)&lt;/span&gt;. We also assume the prior probabilities
of class assignment as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb P(Y = 1) = \pi_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb P(Y = 2) = \pi_2\)&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi_1 + \pi_2 = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given we have observed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbf x\)&lt;/span&gt; what is the probability of it belonging
to class 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\mathbb P(Y = 1 \mid X = \mathbf x)
= \frac{\mathbb P(Y = 1 \cap X = \mathbf x)}{\mathbb P(X = \mathbf x)}
= \frac{f_1(\mathbf x)\pi_1}{f_1(\mathbf x)\pi_1 + f_2(\mathbf x)\pi_2}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thus Bayes rule classifies &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbf x\)&lt;/span&gt; to the class with the highest probability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\varphi(\mathbf x) = \arg \underset{j\in\{1, 2\}}\max \mathbb P(Y = j \mid X = \mathbf x).$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we assign &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbf x\)&lt;/span&gt; to class 1 if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb P(Y = 1 \mid
X = \mathbf x) &amp;gt; \mathbb P(Y = 2 \mid X = \mathbf x)\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f_1(\mathbf x)\pi_1 &amp;gt;  f_2(\mathbf x)\pi_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the populations follow a normal distribution with different means but
equal covariance, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X \mid Y = j \sim \mathcal N(\mu_, \Sigma)\)&lt;/span&gt; We then assign
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbf x\)&lt;/span&gt; to class 1 if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;\frac{f_1(\mathbf x)}{f_2(\mathbf x)} &amp;gt; \frac{\pi_2}{\pi_1} \\
&amp;amp;\Rightarrow \log \frac{f_1(\mathbf x)}{f_2(\mathbf x)} + \log \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2} &amp;gt; 0 \\
&amp;amp;= \log \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2}  + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^T\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf x - \frac{1}{2} (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^T\Sigma^{-1}(\mu_1 + \mu_2) &amp;gt; 0.
\end{aligned}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--
From the last line we recover the discriminant function
$\delta_j(x) = \log\pi_j + \mu_j^T\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf x - \frac{1}{2}\mu_j^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu_j$
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice the true mean and covariance is not known for population
distributions. Instead we use the sample statistic,
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat \mu_j = \bar{\mathbf x_j}\)&lt;/span&gt; for the mean and
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat \Sigma_j = \sum_i (x_i - \bar{\mathbf x_j})^T(x_i - \bar{\mathbf x_j}) \,/\, (n_j - 1)\)&lt;/span&gt;
for the covariance. It is also common to specify the prior probabilites as
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat \pi_j  = n_j \,/\, N\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n_j\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of observations in class
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relaxing Constraints and Generalizing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have looked at the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K =2\)&lt;/span&gt; classes case. For &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K &amp;gt; 2\)&lt;/span&gt; the probability
of observation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbf x\)&lt;/span&gt; being distributed under class &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\mathbb P(Y = j \mid \mathbf x) = \frac{f_j(x)\pi_j(x)}{\sum_{k=1}^K f_k(\mathbf x)\pi_k(\mathbf x)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume the populations do not have the same covariance &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Sigma_j \neq
\Sigma_k\)&lt;/span&gt; we get Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. Gaussian assumption can be
replaced for non-linear decision boundary and the non-parametric version,
&lt;em&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/em&gt; also considers &lt;em&gt;independent conditional probabilities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="before optimized" src="images/before-optimized.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image Compression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;code&gt;0/100&lt;/code&gt; score was the lack of image compression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Googles guideline to &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages"&gt;optimizing images&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce quality to 85 if it was higher. With quality larger than 85, the image
  becomes larger quickly, while the visual improvement is little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce Chroma sampling to 4:2:0, because human visual system is less
  sensitive to colors as compared to luminance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use progressive format for images over 10k bytes. Progressive JPEG usually
  has higher compression ratio than baseline JPEG for large image, and has the
  benefits of progressively rendering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use grayscale color space if the image is black and white.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can be represented using &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php"&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;,
first to change png to ipeg then apply progressive compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;for image in *.png ;  do convert "$image" "${image%.*}.jpg" ; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;for image in *.jpg; do convert "$image"  -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace sRGB "$image"; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as JPEG being a preferred format for photographs they are able to be

&lt;h2&gt;Progressive JPEGs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second &lt;code&gt;0/100&lt;/code&gt; score was the lack of progressive JPEG usage. Standard JPEGs
load from &lt;em&gt;top to bottom&lt;/em&gt;, the image loads line by line. Progressive
JPEGs on the other hand loads the entire image and renders pixel by pixel.
Contrasting with regular JPEGs we can say progressive JPEGs load from back to front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! A 2x speed up in loading time, from 32 to 16 seconds and a 2x reduction in page size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caching?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining poor rating, caching, is managed on the server side. Github pages stores cached
content for only 10 minutes. Ideally for static content such as CSS, JS and images month long
caching is recommended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming your password store is already set up with a local git repository,
create a remote and hidden repository on github. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a new ssh key pair for cloning into the remote repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -O private-openssh -o pass_for_ios.key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;puttygen

&lt;h2&gt;Importing ASCII-armored keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone into this repo to use the asc2qr.sh script

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;asc2qr.sh pass_for_ios.key&lt;/code&gt; to generate Q1.png qr image which encodes your

&lt;p&gt;Similarly for your PGP keys, both public and private, use the script to
generate QR images to import your PGP keys to the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Lesson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallacies of economics, the self-interest of man ad the tendency to see only
the immediate effects of a given policy (overlooking secondary consequences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Lesson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallacies of economics, the self-interest of man ad the tendency to see only
the immediate effects of a given policy (overlooking secondary consequences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can
be reduced to a single sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at
the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the
consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the opposite error is possible. We ought to not concentrate &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
on the long-run results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Broken Window&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boy smashes a bakers window. Community members claim there's positive sum in
this scenario, The payment of the glazer (to fix the window) will allow him to
spend with other merchants, the smashed window will go on providing money and
employment &amp;mdash; The boy was a public benefactor. The public fails to see the
$ 50 the baker loses in repairs. The $ 50 would have gone towards a suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusing need with demand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more war destroys, the more it impoverishes, the greater is the post-war
need. But need is not demand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective economic demand requires not merely need but corresponding
purchasing power. The needs of China today are greater than the USA, its
purchasing power and &lt;em&gt;new business&lt;/em&gt; that it can stimulate, are smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an increase in production for &lt;em&gt;particular products&lt;/em&gt; i.e. diversion of
demand Post war demand in most countries will shrink in absolute amount as
compared to pre-war demand as a result of post-war supply shrinking.&lt;br&gt;
Technological discoveries and advances during the war, may increase individual
or national productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destruction of war will, it is true, divert post-war demand from some
channels into others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain number of people may continue to be deceived indefinitely regarding
their real economic welfare by rising wages and prices caused by an excess of
printed money.  The belief that a genuine prosperity can be brought about by a
"replacement demand" is a fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public Work Means Taxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such public works (infrastructure), necessary for their own sake, and
defended on that ground alone, I am not here concerned. I am here concerned
with public works considered as a means of "providing employment" or of adding
wealth to the community that it would not otherwise have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge built will provide X jobs per year,  however, for a bridge costing
$Y, the taxpayers will lose $Y, which could have been spent on things they
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best, a &lt;em&gt;diversion&lt;/em&gt; of jobs happened as a result of the project, more
bridges, fewer auto mobile workers, farmers. (I don't agree here) Essentially,
one thing has been created instead of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychological benefit of government works are that men are seen to work on
the houses, people live in them and proudly show their friends through the
rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author continues to argue against government projects for the sake of
&lt;em&gt;creating jobs&lt;/em&gt;, (An argument for UBI?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased in tax on corporations (hurting the ability to offset losses against
gains) leads to slower expansion and enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With personal income, risk-taking shrinks (investing in markets?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the
deterrent to private production and employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Credit Diverts Production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming non-inflationary government credit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmer A and B. Farmer A can acquire a loan from private bank, less risk for
the bank as farmer A is reputable. Government hands loan to B as &lt;em&gt;he is denied
from the bank (due to likelihood of unable to pay back loan&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to
losses from incomplete payments, increased interest rates hurt A or farm prices
as the supply decreases (due to government credit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments are encouraged to take on risks &lt;em&gt;too great for private industry&lt;/em&gt;
with taxpayers' money. Where private loans risk their own or face losing
business (hmm...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another illustration of the fallacy of seeing a special short term interest,
forgetting the general interest in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government loans or subsidies to business; taxing successful private business
in order to support unsuccessful ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Curse of Machinery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith's &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 1, without machinery, a workman could
hardly make one pin a day, &amp;hellip; with machinery he can make 4,8000 pins
a day. The fallacy is thinking the jobs lost due to machinery and
overproduction  &amp;hellip; may become chronic (&lt;em&gt;Recent economic changes&lt;/em&gt; - David
A. Wells).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Elasticity&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fall in the price of overcoats causes a larger total amount of money to be
spent on overcoats than previously, then more people may be employed even in
making overcoats than before the new labour-saving machine was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of no surplus of overcoats, just a reduced price for them, the
extra $ z leftover can be spent on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the machine is to increase &lt;em&gt;production&lt;/em&gt;, to raise the standard of
living and increase economic welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology helps increase &lt;em&gt;voluntary&lt;/em&gt; unemployment, people can afford to work
less hours. Children and over-aged aren't required to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines increase money wages or, by reducing prices, increase the goods and
services that the same money can buy. Sometimes both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spread-The-Work Schemes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Fallacy&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is a fixed amount of work to be done in the world, if we cannot add to
this work by thinking up more cumbersome ways, we can think of ways to
distribute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of cutting maximum hours, allowing additional people to be employed,
reduces the wages of the original employee. Furthermore, the purchase of more
leisure was probably not a &lt;em&gt;voluntary&lt;/em&gt; decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In increasing hourly rate to compensate for a shorter working week, an increase
in production costs may happen. A policy of monetary inflation, to enable
prices to rise so the increased hourly wages can be paid disguises &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; wage
rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest downfall is the above fallacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is no limit to the amount of work to be done as long as any human need
or wish that work could fill remain unsatisfied"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disbanding Troops and Bureaucrats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument for encouraging troops to become self-supporting civilians i.e.
integrated into normal civilian workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They (soldiers, policemen, firemen, street cleaners, health officers i.e. key
workers) make it possible for private industry to function in an atmosphere of
law, order, freedom and peace. But their justification consists in the utility
of their services. It does not consist in the "purchasing power" they possess
by virtue of being on the public payroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Fetish of Full Employment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic goal of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest
results with the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximize production, employment merely the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily have full employment without full production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress of civilization has meant the reduction of employment, not its
increase. (Abolished child labour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drive For Exports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports and imports must equal each other in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding to increase our exports, also decide to increase imports &amp;hellip;
foreign exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National government loans (upside to loans not being repaid) -&amp;gt; ???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An export subsidy is a clear case of giving a foreigner something for nothing.
It is another case of trying to get rich by giving things away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad loans and export subsidies may have negative first-order effects, but
greater long-run outcomes. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"Parity" Prices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example, rise in farmer prices so he can afford industrial equipment. Prices
should rise relative to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farmers get more for their crops thus purchase power increases, more
prosperous and buy more for industry products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the increased commodity prices bump up the prices of goods related.
Wheat and bread. The city bread buyer thus loses purchase power, no net
industry gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agricultural increase in business leads to city business decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farmer reducing production for "parity" produces less, his income does not
increase in proportion to his prices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the alleged benefits of still another scheme evaporate as soon as we trace
not only its immediate effects on a special group but its long-run effects on
everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Saving the X Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving industry x as a generalized parity argument/tariff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order that new industries may grow fast enough it is necessary for some old
to be allowed to shrink or die for the sake of releasing capital and labour for
new industries (Horse and buggy trade)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"Stabilizing" Commodities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government intervention -&amp;gt; keeps high-cost producers in the game, causing
inefficiency in the market. Without intervention, the inefficient producers are
driven out, the efficient ones can expand and produce at a lower cost. Thus
raising more capital for the economy. (?) (Advocating for monopolies?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Government Price-Fixing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument for price fixing, keeping costs down so everyone can get a fair share
than only the people with purchasing power allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minimum Wage Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum wage caps the amount of man power by not being able to employ workers
that are worth less than minimum wage. For a low wage you substitute for
unemployment. (hmm...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of minimum wage is for workers being paid below market value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument for scrapping minimum wage states that industry X should be priced out
if it can't pay above minimum wage. However, more jobs lost (whole industry)
more than it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to raise wages is to raise labour productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in capital accumulation (new machines to aid workers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient and industrious workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better education and training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more he produces the more he increases community wealth, the more his
services are worth to consumers and employers hence the more he'll get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons Restated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics is a science recognising &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; consequences and seeing
&lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no change in public taste/morals that would not hurt someone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less policemen, lawyers and judges without criminals (there'll be increase in
another field (?))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs, destruction of machinery, restriction schemes: the insane doctrine of
wealth through scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May always be privately true for any particular group of producers in isolation
but a doctrine which is publicly false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of
economic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Terminology&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Sophism&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A plausible but fallacious argument.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Purchasing power&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;the amount of goods and services that can be purchased with a unit of currency&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Impetus&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;the force with which any body is driven or impelled; Momentum&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why in the East, was I blessed to witness spectacular sunsets daily and now left with only memories of orange-hazed skies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scattering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When white light passes through our atmosphere, gases in our atmosphere absorb and scatter the shorter wavelength (blue and violet). The scattered blue light thus illuminates the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Orange sky at night&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light travelling from the sun near the horizon passes through more atmosphere to reach the observer. Blue light scatters multiple times, leaving longer wavelengths visible &amp;mdash; the yellow, orange and reds found at sunrise and sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clouds &amp;amp; Particles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particles larger than oxygen and nitrogen molecules cause a reduction in saturation hence rural sunsets appear more vibrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an excuse to post my sunset pics.  &lt;em&gt;Enjoy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the sciences, a desire to never stop learning. Mathematics &amp;mdash; It'll open
doors and give you options just like you originally planned. But never forget
about others; people are important, each interaction moulds us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take risks. Ask for more. Feel rejection early on. You'll come to a point in
which you will fail. School is a microcosm, a finite game in an infinite one.
Yes, the lessons learned and grades obtained will decide the paths you can
take. However, it isn't the be-all and end-all. You know this already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about if you should take this on board, whether to explore more outside
school. Make things whilst you're young. Write. Draw. Create. Be aware of
failure but don't shy away from it. Calculated, not dismissive and wholly, risk
averse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to my younger self. If, somehow you we're able to read my advice, what
would become of me today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of Ted Chiang's shorts, Story of Your Life and the Merchant and
the Alchemist's gate, both exploring the nature of time. How, in the first
story the narrator learns to perceive time not in a linear, sequential order
but as "a refracted ray of light must know all possible paths to travel along
the minimal path". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the second,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them
more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future me,&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to what has been said to younger us. I trust you. I trust in the
foundation our younger self has laid. I trust in the decisions we make,
whatever the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the point of hindsight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, writing this, currently believe there's only one thing I regret so far. If
one can learn from their supposed mistake, then I would like to think regret

&lt;p&gt;I didn't give much thought to the political situation before flying out.
Flights were booked and in my mind, Hong Kong was home for the next 10 months.
Protests simmering over summer weren't going away. One side, had to give. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aptly named Special Administration Region, Hong Kong had been surrendered by
China to the British on a 99-year lease. In 1997, the transition began with the
establishment of the "One country, two systems"  policy, lasting until 2047 in
which the handover would be complete. During this period, outlined in Chapter
1, Article 5 of the constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of
life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erosion of this common law happens while our governments and large
institutions ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember 3 years prior, my first time as a sightseer on the A11 bus from the
Chek Lap Kok Airport. As we passed across the Tsing Ma bridge, high-rise
buildings emerged in the distance, growing as we ventured further into the
heart of Hong Kong. I looked out of the window and up. Monolithic tower blocks
loomed over me like the opening scene of Akira. Shouldered together in clusters
they formed mansions, estates and homes. Squeezed between a supermarket and a
medicinal shop, steam waft from the bamboo baskets of a food vendor. In the
same frame, meter-wide circular trays sat outside a dried food shop, scattered
with shrimp. The smell, off putting for some, memorable to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning the majority of the Island, Hong Kong Tramways operates as strident as
the first journey in 1904. No wider than the shoulder width of 3 adults, the
tram system is frequented by locals and tourists. On a day without
responsibility, ride the full 26km circuit from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan
and back. Observe the speed at which the world around moves, time is money and
so is space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting Hong Kong to its most remote districts, the MTR rivals the
efficiency and cleanliness of Singapore's MRT and Tokyo's Metro. Buses run here
too. The service worth noting are the little green or red minibus rocket ships
&amp;mdash; the red ones especially. Without check-pointed stops, one must &lt;em&gt;shout&lt;/em&gt;
where to get off &amp;hellip; in Cantonese of course, or continue the ride on the
world's most cortisol-raising mode of public transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking a local friend what to do with my free time, she replied: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eat." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 3 a.m dim sum to afternoon tea at the Peninsula, it is hard to find an
hour without thinking about food. With 92% of GDP composed of services,
fulfilling your daydreams and stomach is never an issue; spending a leisurely
hour on a bowl of cart noodles, is, however. If warm service and patient staff
are &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to your meal experience, there are plenty of expat-friendly
places that'd gladly offer you an international experience. Old Hong Kong has
no time or space to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the hilly topology, there's no shortage of mountains and peaks in
which the world is seen with childlike awe. Any mountain, hill or peak you
choose (the 19th floor New College pantry anyone?) land, sea and concrete
civilization awaits you at the top. For the adventurous, Hong Kong is hard to
disappoint;  a variety of hiking trails are scattered across the terrain to
roam and explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunsets, high and low are once again novel. The wet marshlands of Pak Nai
overlooks to the Shenzhen special economic zone; sun rays reflect off the
marshland plains creating a mirror world below the horizon. The focus shifts to
the mainland after dusk &amp;mdash; across the sea, Shenzhen illuminates the night
with a white halogen glow. The future is just across the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;11/11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistrust towards the Hong Kong police force grew stronger as the police
increased their aggression on the protestors and the death of Alex Chow, a
HKUST student. On the night before the planned general strike, the police force
stormed a university hall and arrested a student. In response to the invasion,
the universities across Hong Kong barricaded their campuses; road blocks
followed. Peaceful protests continued throughout the week, office workers on
the streets in Central and malls echoing chants of support. Hong Kong's youth,
taking centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Gate entrance, the University of Hong Kong. As police progressed towards
the East gate exit, protestors strengthened their hold on the entrances to the
campus. The empty street decorated with bricks, each block propped upon two
others like legs. By midnight, from Flora Ho to HKU Exit C1, Pok Fu Lam heard
no sirens, all vehicles were re-routed around the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car approaches, stops and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They've come to deliver supplies. Food, masks, helmets, water &amp;hellip;" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were students no older than 18 at the lookout posts, what do their
parents think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ones outside support them. When they were our age they fought the same
struggle we did. It's the revolution of our time." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chapter 1, Article 1:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the
People's Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, China will not back away from what is theirs. The
people of Hong Kong kindle the flame of hope. However small it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2047.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some it can't arrive any faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone who can, see for yourself what it is before it is no more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>grok the term</title><link href="/grok-the-term.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-01-29:/grok-the-term.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few minutes into a conversation about &lt;a href=""&gt;why I use Linux&lt;/a&gt;, I am hit with the question. &lt;em&gt;So what is&lt;/em&gt; a terminal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woah&lt;/em&gt;, a lot more processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox uses a &lt;em&gt;graphical user interface (GUI)&lt;/em&gt; which runs more programs for user accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By interacting with a terminal, I reduce the need to expend resources at the expense of learning a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider another example. Using Notepad++ and Vim. Or Vim and gVim (vim running with a GUI).
Scaling up, we get to a desktop with its clickable menus and convenient taskbar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a laptop that is 10 years old, extra processes takes it's toll.&lt;br&gt;
I also only use a handful of applications: text-editor, file manager, music player, pdf viewer. Everything else is online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No desktop, minimal GUI, only the applications I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Bruce Lee sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. What is Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOCUSED&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DIFFUSE&lt;/strong&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning, its best to make use of both modes, switching between focused and diffuse mode thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning, there are times in which you are focused and times in which you allow your mind to wander.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unfocused, or diffused, mode is just as valuable as the focused mode in allowing your brain to LEARN something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take breaks, meditate, think about other things, and give yourself plenty of time in both modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORKING (short term)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LONG TERM&lt;/strong&gt; memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLEEP&lt;/strong&gt; - vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Chunking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung problem (a German word for Mindset). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master the main idea - survey and priming 
    — this involves scanning a book or the syllabus of a course, for example, to get a general idea of the bigger picture. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe an example. Then, do it yourself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, do it again and again in different contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recall&lt;/strong&gt; - a couple of minutes to summarise/recall material you're trying to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bite sized Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - test yourself as you encounter new material, Recall is a testing technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interleaving&lt;/strong&gt; - know when to apply a particular concept is as important as knowing how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;Spaced Repetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - vary the frequency of revisiting material based on how well you can recall (&lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not important to pass the test without mistakes. Mistakes and correcting them are important to solidify learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphors and analogies - Feynman technique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief notes that summarise key concepts are more effective that highlighting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illusion of competence: don't repeat easy topics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Procrastination and Memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Procrastination&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekly/Daily list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your daily list the evening before. Not writing them down will take up valuable slots of memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set aside 30–60 minutes every day for each task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan your finishing time, just as important as planning your working time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat the frog - Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take notes about what works and what doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Memory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better short term/working memory makes it harder to be creative. it is more likely to experience Einstellung as it will pick up new concepts very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smaller working memory means you can generalise your learning into new, creative combinations. You can get more inputs from the brain due to the memories being less tightly locked in. Your brain is used to being creative with the small amounts of memory it can work on at any period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Potential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/strong&gt; is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practising certain mental patterns deepens your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success is &lt;strong&gt;perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard start - Jump to easy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start on the hardest problem first and move to easy one once you get stuck/lose momentum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let diffuse mode work on the harder problem&lt;/li&gt;

my head when I'm near my Pentel 205, Pilot G5 and A6 notepad or sat in front of
the keyboard of my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's caused me to forget many important-at-the-time insights that may return
one day. I've grown a habit of starting many 'threads' and leaving them to
hang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as I just interrupted another reflection on stray cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not too dissimilar to how brains naturally process thoughts. Non-linear.
Weaving from topic to topic, falling short to fully resolve an idea before
moving onto the next. At this current stage of romantic novelty, I am far from
creating a strict routine in which I can consistently churn out lines of text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my original point of this script. Beginning to write is often the
hardest step. Writer's block is real. However, when the moment arrives and the
flood gates are let loose, let loose. Don't try to contain the stream of
consciousness, apply pen to paper, fingertips to the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this while still avoiding the topic title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grow the tree, whip up a first draft. Sure there'll be reams of content you'll
want to cut out, paragraphs that will need to be edited but that comes after
with pruning your tree. &lt;/p&gt;
