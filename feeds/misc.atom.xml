Wiki&lt;/a&gt; to see alternative
methods. Here I only explain one sequence of setting up a the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your password store is already set up with a local git repository,
create a remote and hidden repository on github. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a new ssh key pair for cloning into the remote repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -O private-openssh -o pass_for_ios.key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;puttygen
pass_for_ios.key -C "Pass for iOS" -O public-openssh -o pass_for_ios.pub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Importing ASCII-armored keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone into this repo to use the asc2qr.sh script
&lt;code&gt;https://github.com/4bitfocus/asc-key-to-qr-code&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I tried using &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/yishilin14/asc-key-to-qr-code-gif&lt;/code&gt;
recommended by the guide but it didn't work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;asc2qr.sh pass_for_ios.key&lt;/code&gt; to generate Q1.png qr image which encodes your
ssh key.  Use it as your authentication method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly for your PGP keys, both public and private, use the script to
generate QR images to import your PGP keys to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git repository url:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssh://git@github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;branch name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;master&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;username&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skewness&lt;/em&gt; issue; it doesn't matter how frequently something succeeds if

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;coup de foudre&lt;/em&gt;, a sudden intense infatuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero's trading style; extreme risk aversion, I love taking small losses, I just
need my winners to be large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero believes that risk-conscious hard work and discipline can lead someone to
achieve a comfortable life with high probability. Beyond that it is all
randomness; either by taking enormous risks, or by being extraordinarily lucky.
Mild success can be explainable by skills and labour. Wild success is
attributed to variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people prefer to make $70k when others around them are making $60k than
making $80k when others are making $90k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serotonin and Randomness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Your dentist is rich, very rich&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternative History.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of a decision cannot be judged based on its
outcome. (Judge decisions based on the costs of the alternative)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 million earned through Russian roulette does not have the same value as if
it were earned through artful practice of dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinction between the mind of a pure mathematician thriving on
abstraction and that of a scientist consumed by curiosity. A mathematician is
absorbed by what goes into his head while a scientist searches into what is
outside of himself. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behaviour not because they won or
lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can no longer visualize a realized outcome without referenced to the
nonrealized ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[History] affects the way I would wish to think by referencing past events, by
being able to better instead; the ideas of others and leverage them, correct
the mental defects that seem to block my ability to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesic patients shows signs of learning without being stored in conscious
memory &amp;mdash; Claparede pin handshake experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(non)Conscious/declarative memory&lt;/em&gt;. Much of the risk avoidance that comes form experiences is part of the
second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of
the information until that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the difference between noise and information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters but
how much is made is when it happens. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it
is the magnitude of the outcome that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popper&lt;/em&gt;, two types of theories: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theories known to be wrong and rejected (falsified)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theories that have not been falsified yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of knowledge and discovery is not so much in dealing with what we
know as in dealing with what we do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;em&gt;open society&lt;/em&gt; no permanent truth is held to exist; allowing for
counter-ideas to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use inductive methods and statistics to make aggressive bets, but I will
not use them to manage my risks and exposure. (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC At Lunchtime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experienced leaps of joy over results that I knew was mere noise, and
bouts of unhappiness over results that did not carry the slightest degree of
statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of know &lt;em&gt;how we should behave&lt;/em&gt;. It is the execution that is the problem.
(Cigarette smoker)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting by convincing everyone that we
are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be
endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution bias&lt;/em&gt;: Attributing success to skill and failures to randomness.
80% think they are above the median in many things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start stressing personal elegance at your next misfortune, Exhibit &lt;em&gt;sapere
vivere&lt;/em&gt; (know how to live) in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress at your best on your execution day. The dignified attitude will make both
defeat and victory feel equally heroic. Try not to blame others of your fate,
even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit any self-pity. Do not complain. The
only article Lady Fortuna has no control over is your behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;Why in the East, was I blessed to witness spectacular sunsets daily and now left with only memories of orange-hazed skies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scattering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When white light passes through our atmosphere, gases in our atmosphere absorb and scatter the shorter wavelength (blue and violet). The scattered blue light thus illuminates the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Orange sky at night&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light travelling from the sun near the horizon passes through more atmosphere to reach the observer. Blue light scatters multiple times, leaving longer wavelengths visible &amp;mdash; the yellow, orange and reds found at sunrise and sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clouds &amp;amp; Particles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particles larger than oxygen and nitrogen molecules cause a reduction in saturation hence rural sunsets appear more vibrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an excuse to post my sunset pics.  &lt;em&gt;Enjoy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; So it's quite unlike preaching?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Entirely. The two roles are completely unattached. When you are standing
in the pulpit, you must sound as though you know what you're talking about.
When you're writing, you're trying to find out something which you don't know.
The whole language of writing for me is finding out something you don't want to
know, what you don't want to find out. But something forces you to anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; For me it's like a journey, and the only thing you know that if when the
book is over, you are prepared to continue &amp;mdash; you haven't cheated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What would be cheating?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoiding. Lying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; An essay is not simpler, though it may seem so. An essay is essentially
an argument. The writer's point of view in an essay is always absolutely clear.
The writer is trying to make the readers see something, trying to convince them
of something. In a novel or a play you're trying to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; them something. The
risks, in any case, are exactly the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your first drafts like?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; They are overwritten. Most of the rewrite, then, is cleaning. Don't
describe it, show it. That's what I try to teach all young writers &amp;mdash;take
it out! Don't describe a purple sunset, make me see that it is purple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; As your experience about writing accrues, what would you say increases
with knowledge?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; You learn how little you know. It becomes much more difficult because
the hardest thing in the world is simplicity. And the most fearful thing, too.
It becomes more difficult because you have to strip yourself of all disguises,
some of which you didn't know you had. You want to write a sentence as clean as
a bone. That is the goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe is no longer a frame of reference, a standard-bearer, the classic
model for literature and for civilization. It's not the measuring stick. There
are other standards in the world. It's a fascinating time to be living. There's
a whole wide world which isn't now as it was when I was younger. When I was a
kid the world was white, for all intents and purposes, and now its struggling
to &lt;em&gt;remain&lt;/em&gt; white &amp;mdash;a very different thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I refuse to. Perhaps the turning point in one's life is realizing
that to be treated like a victim is not necessarily become one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you suggesting they are less concerned, somehow, with social
injustice?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no, you see, I don't want to make that kind of dichotomy. I'm not
asking that anybody get on picket lines or take positions. That is entirely a
private matter. What I'm saying has to do with the concept of the self, and the
nature of self-indulgence which seems to me to be terribly strangling, and so
limited it finally becomes sterile.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; You seem very troubled &amp;mdash;but not by death?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, true, but not at all by death. I'm troubled over getting my work
done and over all the things I've not earned. It's useless to be troubled by
death, because then, of course, you can't live at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you tell younger writers who come to you with the usual
desperate question: How do I become a writer?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Write. Find a way to keep alive and write. There is nothing else to say.
If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if
you're not going to be a writer nothing I can say that will help you. What you
really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is
real.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you discern talent within someone?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent
lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; How does it strike you that in many circles James Baldwin is known as a
prophetic writer?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't try to be prophetic, as I don't sit down to write literature. It
is simply this: a writer has to take all the risks of putting down what he
sees. No one can tell him about that. No one can control that reality. It
reminds me of something Pablo Picasso was supposed to have said to Gertrude
Stein while he was painting her portrait. Gertrude said, "I don't look like
that." And Picasso replied, "You will." And he was right.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Dear me</title><link href="/dear-me.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-05:/dear-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good school work.

the sciences, a desire to never stop learning. Mathematics &amp;mdash; It'll open
doors and give you options just like you originally planned. But never forget
about others; people are important, each interaction moulds us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take risks. Ask for more. Feel rejection early on. You'll come to a point in
which you will fail. School is a microcosm, a finite game in an infinite one.
Yes, the lessons learned and grades obtained will decide the paths you can
take. However, it isn't the be-all and end-all. You know this already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about if you should take this on board, whether to explore more outside
school. Make things whilst you're young. Write. Draw. Create. Be aware of
failure but don't shy away from it. Calculated, not dismissive and wholly, risk
averse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to my younger self. If, somehow you we're able to read my advice, what
would become of me today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of Ted Chiang's shorts, Story of Your Life and the Merchant and
the Alchemist's gate, both exploring the nature of time. How, in the first
story the narrator learns to perceive time not in a linear, sequential order
but as "a refracted ray of light must know all possible paths to travel along
the minimal path". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the second,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them
more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future me,&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to what has been said to younger us. I trust you. I trust in the
foundation our younger self has laid. I trust in the decisions we make,
whatever the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the point of hindsight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, writing this, currently believe there's only one thing I regret so far. If
one can learn from their supposed mistake, then I would like to think regret
doesn't fit. There's still time, only now you know what it feels to lose.  In
all seriousness. I hope whatever you're doing, wherever you are, that you have
stuck to our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nails better be pristine :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>revolution of our time</title><link href="/revolution-of-our-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-03:/revolution-of-our-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"But half of the T-shirts I own are black &amp;hellip;" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't give much thought to the political situation before flying out.
Flights were booked and in my mind, Hong Kong was home for the next 10 months.
Protests simmering over summer weren't going away. One side, had to give. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aptly named Special Administration Region, Hong Kong had been surrendered by
China to the British on a 99-year lease. In 1997, the transition began with the
establishment of the "One country, two systems"  policy, lasting until 2047 in
which the handover would be complete. During this period, outlined in Chapter
1, Article 5 of the constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of
life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erosion of this common law happens while our governments and large
institutions ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember 3 years prior, my first time as a sightseer on the A11 bus from the
Chek Lap Kok Airport. As we passed across the Tsing Ma bridge, high-rise
buildings emerged in the distance, growing as we ventured further into the
heart of Hong Kong. I looked out of the window and up. Monolithic tower blocks
loomed over me like the opening scene of Akira. Shouldered together in clusters
they formed mansions, estates and homes. Squeezed between a supermarket and a
medicinal shop, steam waft from the bamboo baskets of a food vendor. In the
same frame, meter-wide circular trays sat outside a dried food shop, scattered
with shrimp. The smell, off putting for some, memorable to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning the majority of the Island, Hong Kong Tramways operates as strident as
the first journey in 1904. No wider than the shoulder width of 3 adults, the
tram system is frequented by locals and tourists. On a day without
responsibility, ride the full 26km circuit from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan
and back. Observe the speed at which the world around moves, time is money and
so is space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting Hong Kong to its most remote districts, the MTR rivals the
efficiency and cleanliness of Singapore's MRT and Tokyo's Metro. Buses run here
too. The service worth noting are the little green or red minibus rocket ships
&amp;mdash; the red ones especially. Without check-pointed stops, one must &lt;em&gt;shout&lt;/em&gt;
where to get off &amp;hellip; in Cantonese of course, or continue the ride on the
world's most cortisol-raising mode of public transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking a local friend what to do with my free time, she replied: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eat." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 3 a.m dim sum to afternoon tea at the Peninsula, it is hard to find an
hour without thinking about food. With 92% of GDP composed of services,
fulfilling your daydreams and stomach is never an issue; spending a leisurely
hour on a bowl of cart noodles, is, however. If warm service and patient staff
are &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to your meal experience, there are plenty of expat-friendly
places that'd gladly offer you an international experience. Old Hong Kong has
no time or space to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the hilly topology, there's no shortage of mountains and peaks in
which the world is seen with childlike awe. Any mountain, hill or peak you
choose (the 19th floor New College pantry anyone?) land, sea and concrete
civilization awaits you at the top. For the adventurous, Hong Kong is hard to
disappoint;  a variety of hiking trails are scattered across the terrain to
roam and explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunsets, high and low are once again novel. The wet marshlands of Pak Nai
overlooks to the Shenzhen special economic zone; sun rays reflect off the
marshland plains creating a mirror world below the horizon. The focus shifts to
the mainland after dusk &amp;mdash; across the sea, Shenzhen illuminates the night
with a white halogen glow. The future is just across the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;11/11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistrust towards the Hong Kong police force grew stronger as the police
increased their aggression on the protestors and the death of Alex Chow, a
HKUST student. On the night before the planned general strike, the police force
stormed a university hall and arrested a student. In response to the invasion,
the universities across Hong Kong barricaded their campuses; road blocks
followed. Peaceful protests continued throughout the week, office workers on
the streets in Central and malls echoing chants of support. Hong Kong's youth,
taking centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Gate entrance, the University of Hong Kong. As police progressed towards
the East gate exit, protestors strengthened their hold on the entrances to the
campus. The empty street decorated with bricks, each block propped upon two
others like legs. By midnight, from Flora Ho to HKU Exit C1, Pok Fu Lam heard
no sirens, all vehicles were re-routed around the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car approaches, stops and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They've come to deliver supplies. Food, masks, helmets, water &amp;hellip;" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were students no older than 18 at the lookout posts, what do their
parents think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ones outside support them. When they were our age they fought the same
struggle we did. It's the revolution of our time." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chapter 1, Article 1:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the
People's Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, China will not back away from what is theirs. The
people of Hong Kong kindle the flame of hope. However small it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2047.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some it can't arrive any faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone who can, see for yourself what it is before it is no more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Antifragile</title><link href="/antifragile.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-05-26:/antifragile.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Things that gain from disorder"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; make them read the classics. The future is in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mental bias in overhyping technology comes from the fact we notice
change, not statics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; you lost 10,000  vs your portfolio was 785,000 and is now 775,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New things will lose their novelty, &lt;em&gt;treadmill effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy writing facing trees, and, if possible, wild untamed gardens with
ferns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Buildings Learn&lt;/em&gt;, Stewart Brand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was so much traffic in London because people wanted to be there, being
there exceeds the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining into dustbins all these
overhyped works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; student (who was studying economics)&amp;hellip; what to read? "As little
as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books that are not about
the last fifty years,"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original role of the prophet, to warn not to predict. And predict
calamities if people didn't listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something has been around for a very, very long time then irrational or not,
you can expect it to stick around much longer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extension of &lt;em&gt;via negativa&lt;/em&gt; and Fat Tony's &lt;em&gt;don't be a sucker&lt;/em&gt; rule,
non-natural needs to prove its benefits, not the natural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swelling Mother Nature gave me, not directly caused by the trauma but my
body's response to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the drugs available today, I can hardly find a &lt;em&gt;via positiva&lt;/em&gt; one that makes
a healthy person unconditionally "better".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; lobbying for reclassifications of conditions, and fine-tuning sales
tricks to get doctors to overprescribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the patient is near healthy, then Mother Nature should be the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; if the person is very ill, there are no iatrogenics to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something in nature you don't understand, odds are it makes sense
in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and
science do is flawed until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal
gratitude, &amp;hellip;, good bowel movements, no meeting rooms and periodic
surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in heuristics of religion and blindly accommodate its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cretans, &amp;hellip; they lived longer because of the types of food they consumed.
It could be true, but the second-order effect (the variations in intake) could
be dominant,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking effortlessly, &amp;hellip; as I speculate, is necessary for humans, perhaps
as necessary as sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live to improve on information, or improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche had the Latin pun, &lt;em&gt;aut liberi, aut libri&lt;/em&gt;, either children or books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For heroism is the exact inverse of the agency problem: someone bears the
disadvantage for the sake of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-person is not someone who does not have an opinion, just someone who
does not take risks for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;megalopsychon&lt;/em&gt;, a sense of grandeur that was superseded by the Christian value
of "humility". &amp;hellip; If you take risks and face your fate with dignity,
there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don't take risks,
there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take
risks, insults by half-men are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can't
feel insulted by a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hammurabi's code&lt;/strong&gt;: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and
causes the death of the owner, the builder shall be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People voting for war need to have at least one descendant (child or
grandchild) exposed to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; would do if he were
in your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How poetry can kill you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Humanity started] at the rank of an idle freeman, unpreoccupied with work. It
never meant &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; working; it just meant not deriving your personal and
emotional identity from your work, and viewing work as something optional, more
like a hobby. In a way your profession does not identify you so much as other
attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; if for the Greeks, only he who is free with his time is free with his
opinion, for our horizontal friend and advisor, only he who has courage is free
with his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way of checking if you are alive is by checking if you live
variations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woah&lt;/em&gt;, a lot more processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox uses a &lt;em&gt;graphical user interface (GUI)&lt;/em&gt; which runs more programs for user accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By interacting with a terminal, I reduce the need to expend resources at the expense of learning a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider another example. Using Notepad++ and Vim. Or Vim and gVim (vim running with a GUI).
Scaling up, we get to a desktop with its clickable menus and convenient taskbar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a laptop that is 10 years old, extra processes takes it's toll.&lt;br&gt;
I also only use a handful of applications: text-editor, file manager, music player, pdf viewer. Everything else is online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No desktop, minimal GUI, only the applications I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Bruce Lee sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar"&gt;New Years&lt;/a&gt; have arrived
and I'm still without a goal to chase. An accomplishment to achieve by the end
of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CGP Grey video I have decided to make it the year of creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolutions are hard rules to follow.  Humans aren't too good at sticking to
hard rules.  Instead, yearly themes are substituted as a way of defining our
yearly goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of themes is that they aren't strictly defined. This plays well with
ever changing goals and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why creating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, I have been meaning to improve my ability to communicate well
through writing. So far, not much has been produced in terms of publishable
content. I hope to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase the amount of written files I produce.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether that is on daily
  entries on how I feel, technical topics accessible to anyone literate or an
  interesting insight that I would like to review and document in my own words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine and edit new and existing pieces.&lt;/strong&gt; Removing unnecessary words. Not
  being afraid of reading material from my past self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an interesting to see where the year of creativity will take me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goals will I have achieved and how will I define creating in 12 months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a year of creating!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Designs That Don't Suck</title><link href="/designs-that-dont-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nehemiah Tang-Campbell</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-01-28:/designs-that-dont-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.curiositry.com/designs-that-don-t-suck/"&gt;some useful advice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

my head when I'm near my Pentel 205, Pilot G5 and A6 notepad or sat in front of
the keyboard of my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's caused me to forget many important-at-the-time insights that may return
one day. I've grown a habit of starting many 'threads' and leaving them to
hang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as I just interrupted another reflection on stray cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not too dissimilar to how brains naturally process thoughts. Non-linear.
Weaving from topic to topic, falling short to fully resolve an idea before
moving onto the next. At this current stage of romantic novelty, I am far from
creating a strict routine in which I can consistently churn out lines of text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my original point of this script. Beginning to write is often the
hardest step. Writer's block is real. However, when the moment arrives and the
flood gates are let loose, let loose. Don't try to contain the stream of
consciousness, apply pen to paper, fingertips to the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this while still avoiding the topic title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grow the tree, whip up a first draft. Sure there'll be reams of content you'll
want to cut out, paragraphs that will need to be edited but that comes after
with pruning your tree. &lt;/p&gt;
