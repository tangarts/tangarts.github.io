<h1> Chapter 15 </h1>

<div class=date> 
</div>
<div><p>Dear Bond, </p>
<h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
<p>You know son, you are the joy of my life. I hope you pass your driver's test
today. But, if you don't, it's ok, just keep working on it till you do. </p>
<p>Yesterday, as you remember, we left off after discussing the baggie and today,
I think I need to begin to teach you the particulars of how to write copy.</p>
<p>As you will note, we haven't talked about writing copy as of yet. What we <u>have</u>
talked about mainly is the <em>"conceptualization"</em> of our marketing effort.
However, now that we have conceptualized our piles, let's get a little more
technical about the whole process of writing copy. </p>
<p>Here's how to begin: The first thing you need to do is to assemble a file that
contains everything you can get your hands on that is relevant to your
promotion. Here are some of the things that might be included in your file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>List cards describing the lists you are going to test </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the report you intend to sell </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of DM pieces that other people have used to sell products or services
related to what you want to sell. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of space ads that other people have used to sell products or services
related to what you want to sell. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of books and reports on real estate investing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of exceptionally good ads and DM pieces, even if they are not related
to real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of that book I'm going to give you that contains hundreds of
headlines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything else you can think of that might be an <em>idea generator</em>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>OK now, after you have assembled all this stuff, what you need to do is start
reading and taking notes. </p>
<p>Now, here is a little quirk of mine: I have a special way of taking these notes
which, incidentally, I call <em>nugget notes.</em> </p>
<p>You see, what I do is take my notes in the form of little nuggets of
information. When I am done the paper I have been writing on looks like this:</p>
<p>Remember this when you are taking these notes don't stuff yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, my nugget notes consist of just one word. Sometimes they consist of
meaningless phrases. Many times my notes make sense but many times they don't.
No matter. I never worry about it. I just keep writing. I write what occurs to
me as I read the list cards, the jackets of books, the ads, the DM pieces, and
all the rest of the material I have assembled. </p>
<p>Now here are a few things you should always include. A complete description of
your product including how many pages, how many words, how many photos, who
wrote it, facts about the author (his age, background, success stories, etc.).
You should also take notes on what this product will do for you. Will it make
you wealthy? How will more money help your customer? Will he be able to buy a
better car? Take more vacations? Afford a better home? If so, put it down.</p>
<p>OK now, after you have taken all these notes what I want you to do is re-read
the notes and the really good ones, put a star * beside them. And the ones that
are even better put two stars <strong> next to them. And then, the red hot ones you
put three </strong>* or more stars beside them.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, what you need to do is <u>stop</u> working on this project. That's
right. Just let it go. Put it right out of your mind. Just go on about your
other business for a day or two. </p>
<p>Now then, often what happens during this time, is that an <u>outstanding</u> sales
idea will occur to you. Sometimes this idea will be how to get attention like
with my baggie idea. </p>
<p>Bond, I got interrupted here. Two prison guards came over and searched me and
B. and told us to stay out of the little park where we take our breaks.
Apparently, some little kid was caught smoking pot here yesterday.</p>
<p>Ah well, that's life in the big city. </p>
<p>So let's get started again. As I was saying, sometimes your breakthrough idea
or <em>aha experience</em> will be a way to get attention like my baggie idea, or a
new way to help the prospect visualize the benefits of owning what you have to
sell, or a new order generating sales point or whatever. Anyway, at this point
you now need to begin writing your letter according to formula.  By formula I
mean you should work within a proven sequential outline like AIDA. </p>
<p>What does AIDA stand for? It stands for ATTENTION, INTEREST, DESIRE, ACTION.
So, to make it clearer your letter should: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, get his attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, get him interested</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, make him desire what you are selling </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compel him to take whatever action is needed to get whatever it is you are
selling. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tomorrow, we'll go over this in more detail. But for today, once again I want
to wish you HAPPY BIRTHDAY!</p>
<p>I love you and good luck!</p>
<p>Dad</p>
