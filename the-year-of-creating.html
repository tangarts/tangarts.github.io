<h1> The Year of Creating </h1>

<div><h3>It's not too late for new years resolutions!</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar">New Year(s)</a> have arrived
and I'm still without a goal to chase. An accomplishment to achieve by the end
of the year.</p>
<p>From the CGP Grey video I have decided to make it the year of creating.</p>
<p>Resolutions are hard rules to follow.  Humans aren't too good at sticking to
hard rules.  Instead, yearly themes are substituted as a way of defining our
yearly goals.</p>
<p>The beauty of themes is that they aren't strictly defined. This plays well with
ever changing goals and circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>So why creating?</strong></p>
<p>For months, I have been meaning to improve my ability to communicate well
through writing. So far, not much has been produced in terms of publishable
content. I hope to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase the amount of written files I produce.</strong> Whether that is on daily
  entries on how I feel, technical topics accessible to anyone literate or an
  interesting insight that I would like to review and document in my own words.</li>
<li><strong>Refine and edit new and existing pieces.</strong> Removing unnecessary words. Not
  being afraid of reading material from my past self.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be an interesting to see where the year of creativity will take me. </p>
<p>What goals will I have achieved and how will I define creating in 12 months.  </p>
<p>To a year of creating!</p></div>
