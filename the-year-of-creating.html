<h1>The Year of Creating</h1>
<div class=date>2020-01-29

<hr>

<div><h3>It's not too late for new years resolutions!</h3>
<p>The New Year(s) have arrived and i</p>
<p>Taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar">CGP Grey video</a> I have decided to make it the year of creating.</p>
<p>The premise of the video is that resolutions are hard rules to follow. 
Humans aren't too good at sticking to hard rules. 
Instead, yearly themes are substituted as a way of deifining our yearly goals.</p>
<p>The beauty of themes is that they aren't strictly defined. This plays well with ever changing goals and circumstances.</p>
<p>So why creating?</p>
<p>For months, I have been meaning to improve my ability to communicate well through writing. So far, not much has been produced in terms of publishable content. I hope to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Increase the amount of written files I produce.</em> Whether that is on daily entries on how I feel, technical topics accessible to anyone literate or an interesting insight that I would like to review and document in my own words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Refine and edit</em> new and existing pieces. Removing unecessary words. Not being afraid of reading material from my past self.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be an interesting to see where the year of creativity will take me. What goals will I have achieved and how will I define creating in 12 months.</p>
<p>To a year of creating!</p></div>
