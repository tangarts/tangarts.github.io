<h1> Chapter 11 </h1>

<div class=date>

<div><p>Dear Bond,</p>
<p>As I left you yesterday, we had just came up with a working title for our real
estate investment report. I believe it was "The Amazing L.A.  Roadmap To Real
Estate Riches!"</p>
<p>Maybe we can come up with a better title but this one is fine. At least for
now. I believe we have also discussed extracting the goodies from several real
estate books and we have collected and examined other DM pieces and MO ads for
books and so forth that deal with real estate investments. We know how to
choose a list to test and now it's time for us to create the DM promotion.</p>
<p>The first thing we are going to discuss is the outside envelope. This is where
most mailers mess up first. You see, what most mailers do is put so-called
"teaser copy" on the outside envelope and, in general, design the envelope so
that it is very obvious that it contains a sales pitch.</p>
<p>If you will turn the page, I will show you what a typical direct mail outer
envelope looks like. Whoops. We're here already!</p>

<p>Pretty obvious, isn't it? In time, you are going to read my semi-famous A-Pile,
B-Pile lecture. But here is a preview:</p>
<p>It is my contention that everybody divides their mail every day into two piles.
An "A-Pile" and a "B-Pile". The "A" pile contains letters that appear to be
personal. Like letters from friends, relatives, business associates, and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the "B" pile contains those envelopes that, like the example
above, obviously, contain a commercial message.</p>
<p>Now, here's the way it works: Everybody always opens <u>all</u> of their "A" pile
mail.</p>
<p>And, for obvious reasons. After all, everybody wants to read their personal
mail.</p>
<p>What happens to the "B" pile mail? Does it always get opened? No. It doesn't.
Sometimes it is thrown away immediately without the envelope ever being opened.
Sometimes, if it looks interesting, "B" pile envelopes will be set aside for
later examination. And, of course, sometimes... <strong>IF</strong> the envelope looks
interesting, or <strong>IF</strong> the person receiving it has some idle time, or <strong>IF</strong> the person
is bored and has nothing else to do, than, <strong>MAYBE</strong> the "B" pile envelopes will be
opened.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Quite obviously, people aren't getting to order from you unless they <u>read</u> your
promotion and, also, quite obviously, they can't read your promotion unless
they open the envelope.</p>
<p>And so, my dear son, what is our first objective here, as we begin to design
our DM promotion? You are right! Our first objective is to get our envelope
into the "A" pile.</p>
<p>And, it's so easy to do! All we have to do is make the envelope look personal.
(Or at least we will take pains so it doesn't look commercial.) Here is what
our envelope should look like:</p>
<hr>
<p>209 - 5th Ave.<br>
New York, NY<br>
10049  </p>
<p>{corner card with return address ONLY; no company name}     </p>
<p>{an honest-to-God live 1st class stamp}</p>

<p>{a handwritten or typed address; no label}</p>
<hr>
<p>Nearly everybody who receives this envelope will open it. Why? The answer, as a
copywriter would say, is simple. A person who gets this envelope will open it
to find out what is inside. Because it is intriguing. Because it looks
personal. Because it might be from someone he knows. Because it does not
<u>OBVIOUSLY</u> contain a personal message.</p>
<p>Yes, my dear son, for all these good reasons, the person who gets this envelope
will open it in order to find out what is inside.</p>
<p>You see, the "B" pile envelope let's the recipient know right from the jump
that it contains a commercial message. And, of course, the recipient ALREADY
KNOWS that this envelope does not contain any sort of personal communication.</p>
<p>Too bad. Too bad for the mailer, that is. Because, and this should be painfully
apparent, because if only half as many people open your envelope, only half as
many even have a CHANCE to order!</p>
<p>So obvious, so simple and so <u>OVERLOOKED</u>!</p>
<p>Yes, it's true. As obvious as this should be, it is missed by almost every
advertising agency and nearly every so-called "direct mail expert" in the
country.</p>
<p>So, I'll get off my podium. If I haven't made my point by now, shame on me.
And, now, let's assume that we have designed an "A" pile envelope and we are
relatively sure that our envelope will be opened. What's next? What's next is
that we must now get our potential customer to <u>begin</u> reading our sales letter.</p>
<p>How do we do that? Well, let's start by getting his attention. And intriguing
the heck out of him right from the start. Let's try this: Let's get a little
plastic baggie and put some dirt in it and then attach it to the top of our
letter. Here is what the letter will look like:</p>
<hr>
<p>{little zip lock baggie <br>
attached here with<br>
dirt inside}  </p>

<p>{little directive that tells the</p>
<p>reader what to do from here}</p>
<hr>
<p>Pay attention: What I have just shown you contains several of my little-known
DM secrets. Let's examine them one by one.</p>
<p>First of all, that little baggie filled with dirt just sort of reaches right
out and grabs you, doesn't it?</p>
<p>If you received this letter, wouldn't you be wondering, "What's in this
baggie?" "Is that dirt in there?" "Why would somebody be sending me a baggie of
dirt?"</p>
<p>And, consciously or unconsciously, you would be thinking, "I better read this
and find out what it is all about."</p>
<p>And, you see, we now have not only captured our reader's attention, we have
gotten his "focused" attention.</p>
<p>Quality attention.</p>
<p>Now, what about that part right above the salutation? The part that contains
the day, date and time. What is the significance of all this?  Tune in tomorrow
and see!</p>
<p>I Love You and Good Luck!</p>

<p>Yesterday I ram (jogged) the hill 5 times non-stop in 58 minutes and 18 seconds
and after the run I weighed 176-1/2 pounds.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is basically his famous A-pile B-pile speech.</p>
<p>Allow me to expand on something about getting your letter or sales pitch
through to the reader.</p>
<p>The higher the price of your product and/or if your reader is likely to
have someone screen their mail, then a little more is needed than a simple
envelope.</p>
<p>He still never resorted to teaser copy because it brings on what he
called the "oh yuck" factor, basically alerting everyone that it is junk mail.
The only things I have ever seen my dad put on the outside of envelopes with a
sales pitch were "First Class" or "Personal" in red ink but never did anything
give any clue as to what was inside.</p>
