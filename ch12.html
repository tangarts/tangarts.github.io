<h1> Chapter 12 </h1>

<div class=date> 
</div>
<div><p>Dear Bond, </p>
<p>Let's get right back to that real estate letter. I've already pointed out how
that little baggie filled with dirt will attract and focus our reader's
attention. Now, let's talk about the other particulars of the first page of
that letter.</p>
<p>I think I left off in my last letter where I was just about to comment on the
part above the salutation, the part that tells the day of the week, the exact
time, the day of the month and the year. Why is it important to put these
specifics in the letter?</p>
<p>Well, it makes the letter a little more personal, doesn't it? I mean seriously,
don't you feel a little closer to me because I put all this data in each of my
letters to you? I think so. I think this way of doing things bonds the writer
and the reader closer together. It also gives our transmission the quality of
immediacy. And, while I'm on the subject, it just occurred to me that I should
tell you that another additional way to achieve this bond of intimacy and
immediacy in your letters is to describe where you are and what you are doing
as you are writing the letter.</p>
<p>For example, right now I am sitting cross-legged on my back here in room 7 of
dorm 6 in the Boron Federal Prison Camp. I have just finished running the hill
five times (4-miles) and I did it in 57 minutes and 5 seconds. </p>
<p>Do you see how this type of personal <u>specific</u> info bonds the reader and writer
closer together? You do? Good. I'll continue.</p>
<p>Now, here's another little thought: When you tell the day of the week plus the
exact time you are writing the letter, it makes it seem a more important
communication too, doesn't it? Sort of like a telegram. There's no doubt about
it: A time-dated communication carries considerable more weight than one which
is not. </p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the salutation. Notice that the salutation addresses our
reader by name, just like I do in these letters to you. "Dear Bond" gets a
certain quality of focused attention that is not enjoyed by "Dear Sir" or "Dear
Occupant" or "Dear Reader". </p>
<p>Think about it. When you read the words "Dear Bond", you know my letter is for
you personally, don't you? It's not for Kevin.  It's not for whoever owns the
house. Or anybody who lives at the address on the envelope. No. The words "Dear
Bond" indicate that this letter is for you and you alone.</p>
<p>And this makes you pay more attention, doesn't it? </p>
<p>Now, if you will look in the lower right hand corner of the letter in my
illustration and, also, in all of my other letters, you will see, in
parenthesis, a tiny little instruction like this: <strong>(over)</strong> or like this: <strong>(go to
page 7)</strong>.  What I am doing here is taking the reader by the hand and leading him
exactly where I want him to go. It seems like a small point and, maybe it is,
but is the little touches like this that keeps the letter flowing, the reader
moving along, and, it relieves him of the burden of trying to figure out what
he is supposed to do when he finishes reading a particular page.</p>
<p>Don't scoff. Quite often (most often) your letter will arrive when your
prospect is busy, when his mind is on other things.  Therefore, you need to
work hard to make reading your letter pleasant, easy-read, interesting and
unconfusing.</p>
<p>Well, here I am once again starting to write without knowing where I am going.
All I know is that when I keep moving and writing and flowing that generally
something decent emerges.  We'll see. </p>
<p>No, wait. I know what I'll tell you. How about what else goes inside the
carrier envelope in addition to the letter? One thing for sure is that you must
include a reply envelope. Now, when it comes to reply envelopes, you basically
have two choices. The options are to make the reader pay the postage when he
mails the envelope or for you to pay the postage for him. There are two ways
for you to pay the postage. One of these is to simply put a "live" stamp on the
envelope so that it will be all ready to mail when he receives it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of advantages to this strategy and one big disadvantage. The
disadvantage is cost. Right now, at 20Â¢ per stamp it will cost you $200.00
extra per thousand to do business this way. And, naturally, because of this,
most mailers never even test this option. </p>
<p>That's too bad. Really. Because sometimes, this strategy will pay off.
Therefore, I believe, when either or both of the following conditions exists
you should test a SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope): </p>
<p><strong>Condition #1</strong>: You are selling a high-ticket item where the profit structure is
such that one additional sale per thousand letters mailed will yield more than
enough profit to pay for your SRE's.</p>
<p>This means, of course, that each sale you make has to have a mark up of at
least $200.00. </p>
<p>You know what? What I just wrote may not be quite accurate.  Because, if you
think about it, if those SRE's bring in two or more orders per M, then your
mark up on each sale would only have to be $100.00. If they bring in three
extra orders per M, the mark up would only have to be $70.00 per unit to make
it feasible.</p>
<p>And so on. </p>
<p><strong>Condition #2</strong>: You should test a SRE whenever you can make the recipient of your
letter feel guilty if he doesn't reply. This works especially well for charity
or fund raising letters. For example, you might have a line in one of your
letters that goes something like this: </p>
<p>"...and those pitiful children need your help <u>right now</u>! So please send a check
immediately and send as much as possible.  That's all you have to do. I have
already addressed the reply envelope and I have even gone to the expense of
putting a stamp on it so you won't have to hunt for one!"</p>
<p>Pretty good guilt, eh? And you can also use guilt in a <u>regular</u> sales letter.
Here's how:</p>
<p>Continued Tomorrow </p>
<p>I Love You and Good Luck!</p>
<p>Dad</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>There is no reason to add or detract from this letter at all.</p>
<p>The paragraph in which he wrote about, where he is sitting while writing the
letter holds great meaning to me personally. </p>
<p>My father and I have both always been people who loved to go see places we have
read about in books and magazines or places we have seen in the movies. </p>
<p>Pop went to Jamaica to see all the places where they filmed Doctor No and even
stayed in the Fleming Estate before it was a specialty tourist hotel. He said
he sat at the desk where Ian Fleming wrote some of the Bond novels. </p>
<p>On a lark, I was looking up the old Boron Prison Camp and decided to take a
drive out there. As it turns out, it is now an abandoned property. Most of the
structures while stripped of anything of value, are still labeled.</p>
<p>It gave me a chance to see inside Boron beyond the visiting areas and actually
walk the hill my father speaks of in the letters. </p>
<p>This particular paragraph inspires me to put more detailed info of where I am
while writing my letters to my kids, because it is really neat to be able to
know exactly where he was at that moment in time.</p>
<p>His note about being more personal couldn't be more on target. </p>
<p>Another quick personal note. As you can plainly see my father and I were never
ashamed to show each other affection and now that he is gone, knowing that we
were that close brings me more solace than anything else he could have done.</p>
