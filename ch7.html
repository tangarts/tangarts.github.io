<h1> Chapter 7 </h1>

<div class=date>
</div>
<p>Dear Bond, </p>
<p>Let's get right back into the subject of becoming a student of markets,
especially mailing lists. </p>
<p>My last letter gave you a beginning insight into what makes a list more
responsive. Let's review a few conclusions we came to based on the data in
yesterday's letter. You will remember, of course, that I said that, as a
general rule, any list of proven mail order buyers will out perform any list of
non-buyers. </p>
<p>Now, as another general rule, there are three main guidelines you can rely on
when you are picking lists to test.</p>
<p>These three guidelines are recency, frequency and unit of sale.  A brief
explanation follows: </p>
<p><u>Recency</u> - The more recently a person has purchased (by mail) something similar
to what you are selling, the more receptive he will be to your offer. Get 'em
while they're hot! In fact, always check to see if the list you are interested
in has "hotline buyers" and see if you can rent them before anybody else.
Hotline buyers are the most recent buyers of all.  Sometimes they will be
90-day hotline buyers or even 30-day hotline buyers. These names are extremely
good prospects!</p>
<p><u>Frequency</u> - The more often a person buys a particular item, the higher his
desire for that type of production service. It just makes sense. If you are
selling a book on skin diving and you can find a list of people who have
purchased several other books on skin diving, then you know he is interested in
the subject and will be a likely prospect to buy <u>your</u> book.</p>
<p><u>Unit of sale</u> - Once again, we have a guideline that just plain makes sense.
After all, a person who recently paid $100.00 for a bottle of diet pills is
probably a hotter prospect for diet type products than a person who has only
paid $10.00 for a bottle of diet pills.</p>
<p>You know, Bondo-Dog, people don't always put their money where their mouths
are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires
are.</p>
<p>Recency, frequency and unit of sale: All good guidelines for evaluation of a
mail order list. And, in my opinion, of the three guidelines, <u>RECENCY</u> is, by
far, the most important of all. </p>
<p>Now, let's discuss some other ways of finding out what people like to purchase
by mail. In addition to mailing lists, there are a number of so called "hot"
mail order publications. These are the newspapers and magazines that mail order
companies advertise in over and over. You should make it a point to discover
what these publications are and get copies of them and become very familiar
with them. You should pay attention to their editorial content and pay special
attention to the mail order ads they carry.</p>
<p>There is a newsletter out of New York City called the "Gallagher Report". This
newsletter covers the world of advertising and once each year they publish a
special edition that lists all of the major magazines and it ranks them by
circulation.</p>
<p>You should get a copy of this special issue (ask Eric) and then get copies of
the top 100 magazines and go through them and find out which ones carry a lot
of mail order ads.</p>
<p>I have just come in after visiting with you, Kevin, Blade and Z and a
digression at this point might be productive. Z, as I am sure you will agree,
probably feels a certain sense of relief that, because of the circumstances,
she has more or less gotten her own way in regards to her ad. It's really too
bad. <u>Too bad for her<u>! You have just seen an excellent example of why I
generally treat clients with an iron fist. Z pulled this same stunt when she
had her other ads written (by other people) and the ads were miserable
failures. </p>
<p>If I were on the street I would have handled this situation in a totally
different way. In fact, after about 5-minutes I would have told her to get lost
and that she either gets out of my face or else she can write her own ad. </p>
<p>The lesson here concerns control. Can you imagine how disastrous it would be if
a patient could tell his surgeon how to do the operation? Or, if an athlete
could tell his coach how to do his job? </p>
<p>I could go on and on. But isn't it ridiculous! A client pays me big money to
write an ad and then they want to tell me how to do it!</p>
<p>It happens all the time. But not with me. At least not when I am on the
outside. You see, part of the reason I am in so much demand is that I am so
hard headed. Clients, although they would never admit it, most often feel
relieved with someone who takes a "don't you dare mess with my copy" attitude. </p>
<p>As you know, I couldn't make a scene in the visiting room but you can be sure
that the next time I talk with Z that I am going to quietly but firmly put a
lot of pain in her brain.</p>
<p>Here's another illustration of the importance of control. When Blade took me
aside, one of the things he explained to me was that (name deleted) in Vegas
wants to put the commissions into another project and delay paying me. </p>
<p>Now, here's the thing. (Name deleted) is one of the <u>good guys</u>.  And, sadly,
even the good guys have trouble living up to their agreements when it comes to
money. That's one of the reasons I try to structure my deeds so that I get paid
<u>often</u>. You see, when there is big money involved it is very hard for the
clients to write those checks. </p>
<p>And, what really makes it hard for the client is that he usually believes that
he doesn't need you anymore since he already has the ad.</p>
<p>Ah, there's a lesson here but, also, I'm blowing off steam.  Let's get back to
becoming aware of markets. Right here, what I want to do is encapsulate one of
Halbert's Rules of Marketing Success. It is:</p>
<p>Sell People What They Want To Buy! </p>
<p>So obvious, so overlooked and so important.</p>
<p>Now one thing I haven't mentioned so far is that you want to be on the lookout
for ads and direct mail pieces that you see over and over. What this means is
that whomever is running the ad has hit a nerve. </p>
<p>And, a good way for you to make money is for you to hit that same nerve only do
it better.</p>
<p>But, and I know I'm being redundant, the most important thing to do first is to
<u>locate</u> those hot buttons. You don't have to guess. You don't have to wonder.
You don't have to ask people or take surveys.</p>
<p>All You Have To Do Is Observe! </p>
<p>Observe the ads that keep repeating. Observe the size of the mailing lists
available for rental on different product areas.  Observe the direct mail
pieces that keep getting mailed out month after month and sometimes year after
year. </p>
<p>More tomorrow. </p>
<p>I Love You and Good Luck!</p>
<p>Dad</p>
