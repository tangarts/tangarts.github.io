<h1> Chapter 24 </h1>

<div class=date> 
</div>
<div><p>Dear Son,</p>
<p>Well, I'm feeling better today. I think these short, frequent
days of fasting are really cleaning me out. I really feel a need 
now, more than ever, to shed my excess weight because it is
starting to get really hot here. In fact, I'll be it's 80
degrees or so already this morning.</p>
<p>Anyhow. What I want to tell you this morning is that after 
tomorrow I am going to stop writing these letters for a while. 
There are several reasons: For example, I need to review some
reference material and take notes and then, more or less 
outline, the future letters as my babblings seem to me to be 
getting too random. Another thing is that I want you to get this 
first batch of 25 letters typed up so I can easily review them 
and take notes from them also. And, also, I need to catch up on
some of my other work like filing my rule 35 motion (a request 
for a modification of sentence) so I'll have a chance of getting 
out of here earlier. </p>
<p>And, finally, I have a couple of "bankers" who are eager for me
to develop some promotions which they will finance and then we 
will split any profits 50/50.</p>
<p>And you know what? I think an excellent way for you to learn how 
to make money in this business is to watch over my shoulder as I 
begin to create one profitable promotion after another.</p>
<p>Here's how I'm going to start: First of all, I am going to go
through the SRDS book and make a note of all the lists that look 
like hot markets. Then, I'm going to show Eric this list of
lists and ask for his comments. I'm sure he will be able to add
to my lists and maybe he will also be able to tell me that some
of the lists are really not so hot.</p>
<p>In any case, after all that, I will have a page full of list 
selections and I will write you a letter telling you what lists
I have selected. After that, I will put on my thinking cap and 
develop some product ideas to try and sell to the various lists. 
By the way, I would very much appreciate any ideas that pop into 
your head after you see my list of lists. Well, in any case, 
after all this, I will sleep on it and then, pretty soon, I will 
codify (isn't that a neat word) and isolate the projects I want
to work on.</p>
<p>Then I'll talk to my bankers.</p>
<p>Here's the way it works with my bankers. If they see a project 
they would like to be involved with, they will have to come up 
with a development fee of $5,000.00. (Believe me, that's peanuts 
to these guys.) This $5,000.00 will be used to create a DM piece 
and to make a test mailing of that piece to 2-5M names. We will
also use some of the money for product development.</p>
<p>O.K. after that, if the response is no good, the banker will eat 
his $5,000.00 loss and we will go on to the next project.</p>
<p>If, however, the results look good, we will then proceed to a
larger mailing of perhaps 50,000 pieces. And then, after we get
our results from the 50,000 pieces, if everything still looks
good, we will start rolling out and taking care of business. </p>
<p>It's a good outline, I think. I intend to keep you informed
every step of the way and I'll let you "live" the development of 
these projects with me. And, as a matter of fact, I think I will 
let you help me with some of these projects and give you a small 
cut of the action. </p>
<p>So, sharpen your driving skills. Do your roadwork and get
cracking on all those other things I told you were good things 
to do. I'll join you again on my lunch hour. </p>
<p>Well, kiddo, it's past the lunch hour but better late than 
never, eh? Whatever. I'm stuck for a theme again. What do you
suggest? O.K. How about the subject of IMPACT? Good, I'm glad
you agree. </p>
<p>Impact is the impression you or your promotion makes on its
intended target. Someone once said that the average American is
subjected to about 1,500 commercial messages every day. Probably 
so. Especially when you count billboards, ads on TV, ads on
radio, ads on the backs of buses, on taxicabs, on match covers,
in newspapers, magazines, direct mail pieces, etc., etc. </p>
<p>However, out of all those ads very very few have any appreciable 
impact. And impact is one of the things I strive for.</p>
<p>And, what I want to talk about right now is my favorite way in 
all the world to achieve impact with my DM promotions. What I'm
talking about is attaching things to the top of my letters. I've 
mentioned this before but now I want to go into it in
considerably more detail.</p>
<p>The best letter ever to use this technique was the classic 
"dollar bill" letter featured in "The Robert Collier Letter
Book." (must reread) </p>
<p>This was a first class letter that was designed to raise funds 
for a children's hospital. When the recipient opened the 
envelope he discovered a personal typed letter with a real 
honest-to-goodness dollar bill attached to it. The copy
explained that the writer wanted to donate a thousand dollars to 
a certain children's hospital but that he realized that a
thousand dollars wouldn't go very far. So, what he (the writer)
had decided to do was divide his $1,000.00 contribution into 
1,000 - one dollar bills and then mail these bills to 1,000
different people. Now, he went on to say, what he hoped is that
everybody who received one of these dollar bills would decide
not to keep it and, instead, send it straight to the hospital
with one or more dollars of their own. </p>
<p>Did it work? Oh my! It was probably the most effective direct
mail promotion ever mailed. It got better than a 90% response
and the people to whom it was mailed eventually contributed tens 
of millions of dollars!</p>
<p>That's Impact! </p>
<p>Today, in the mail, I received a copy of my Japanese "Penny" 
promotion. This promotion, as you know, has a Japanese "Penny" 
attached to the top of the letter and the copy says that the 
writer is attaching the penny to the letter for two important
reasons. </p>
<p>The first reason is to get attention. And, secondly, because 
what the letter has to talk about was discovered in Japan, the 
writer felt that some sort of "Japanese" eyecatcher was
appropriate. </p>
<p>This letter is working like crazy. It has impact.</p>
<p>But, be careful. Whatever you attach to the top of your letters
should tie in with the rest of your letter and what you are
selling. It should make sense and fit into the promotion in a
natural way. </p>
<p>Here is an example of how not to use impact: Some companies
print up advertising that, at first glance, looks like a traffic 
ticket. Then, they hire kids to put these traffic ticket type
ads on the windshields of parked cars. </p>
<p>What happens is, that the owner of the car comes back to 
discover what seems to be a traffic ticket on his windshield and 
he, naturally, grabs it forthwith and starts to read it. </p>
<p>It sure gets his attention. It sure achieves impact. The guy 
will sure remember that company. </p>
<p>But He Will Remember The </p>
<p>Company With Distaste! </p>
<p>He Will Remember That This </p>
<p>Is A Company That Scared </p>
<p>Him And Made Him Angry!</p>
<p>You know what all that adds up to? </p>
<p>No Sale! </p>
<p>The message is clear: You must not use "cheap tricks". Make what 
you attach to the letter "fit in". All it takes is a little
imagination. Let's see if I can come up with a couple of 
original examples: </p>
<p>How about attaching an eagle feather to a letter that tells how
these birds are in danger of becoming extinct? </p>
<p>How about attaching a Mexican Peso to a letter that talks about
inflation? I did it and it was a great puller. </p>
<p>How about a computer microchip attached to a letter that 
explains why a certain new electronic product is superior to the 
competition? </p>
<p>How about my son attaching a picture of himself to a letter to 
his old man that tells him how he is getting into good shape?</p>
<p>How about you send me some ideas along these lines?</p>
<p>I Love You and Good Luck </p>
<p>Dad</p></div>
