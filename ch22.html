<h1> Chapter 22 </h1>

<div class=date> 
</div>
<div><p>Dear Bond, </p>
<p>O.K. Buddy, here we go again. That section on propositions and 
an "excuse for a deal" was quite interesting, wasn't it? </p>
<p>You know, I think my letters are getting a little bit random but 
that's O.K. I sort of think it's good to write about what pops 
into my mind, at least for right now, and then maybe we can
review all these letters later and make something out of them
that's more cohesive.</p>
<p>So anyway, today I'm going to start by telling you about a 
little trick that will improve your copywriting. And that little 
trick is to read your copy out loud. What happens when you read
your copy out loud is that you will verbally stumble over all
the places that are not smooth. Then, of course, what you do, is 
rewrite the rough spots and read the copy out loud again. And, 
what you do, is you keep repeating this process till your copy 
is completely smooth and you can read it without stumbling at
all. </p>
<p>You see, advertising writing needs to be the best writing of 
all. It needs to flow from start to finish without a bump or a 
bubble.</p>
<p>Now, do you remember how I told you to write out in your own 
handwriting good ads and DM pieces written by other people? You
do remember? Good. Well, what I want to tell you here is that
you should also read those same ads and DM pieces out loud. You
see, by doing this writing and reading aloud of good material
you will find that the process of writing good ads will be 
internally imprinted on your nerves, muscle fibers, brain cells
and every fiber of your being. </p>
<p>So, the message is clear: Get yourself a collection of good ads
and DM pieces and read them aloud and copy them in your own
handwriting. </p>
<p>So, now what? Here I am stuck again. But not for long. What
happened during my last break is I put together a deal and I 
think maybe it would be a good idea at this point to talk a
little about the business of mail order. Here's how some of my 
deals work:</p>
<p>What I am doing is going through the SRDS list book and looking
for mailing lists that I think will yield a good profit if 
exploited properly.</p>
<p>O.K., after I have identified the list I want to go after I then 
start thinking about a product to sell to that list. By the way, 
I am especially interested in selling paper and ink and, 
specifically, written reports that solve a problem for the 
people on the mailing list. Here are some tentative titles of
reports that will give you an idea of what I mean: </p>
<p>"How To Raise Your Child's I.Q. Before It Is Even Born!" </p>
<p>(for expectant mothers)</p>
<p>"How To Fix Your Car To Get 50% More Miles Per Gallon!"</p>
<p>(for owners of gas guzzlers) </p>
<p>"How To Collect From Social Security At Any Age!"</p>
<p>(I already did this one and made \$800,000.00 from it.) </p>
<p>And so on. Well, after I have identified the list and come up
with the idea for the product, I then discuss this project with
one of my bankers. If he likes the project (and they nearly
always do) what they do is they put up roughly about \$5,000.00 
to get everything going. This five thousand is used to develop 
the report I want to sell, to rent the test names, to pay all
costs of the test, etc.</p>
<p>Then what happens is I create the DM promotion and have Blade
put it into the mail. Now then, one of three things will happen. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It will be a decided loser. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be a decided winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be marginal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If it is a decided loser my "banker" will have lost his
\<span class="math">\(5,000.00. If it is a decided winner my banker will then put up
perhaps another \\)</span>50,000 and we will mail approximately 100,000 
pieces to get the ball rolling. Then, after that, we will
finance the rest of the mailing from our cash flow and my banker 
and I will split the profit. </p>
<p>Very clean. Very neat. Very straight.</p>
<p>What if it's marginal? Well, in that case we will discuss the
project again and make a judgment as to whether or not it makes
sense to risk another \$5,000 for another test. </p>
<p>Whatever. That's the way it works and it's a nice simple way of
doing business. Well, Bondy, I'm going to stop for now. I am 
having a pretty sad day. Don't worry though, I'm O.K., just a
little heartsick.</p>
<p>Such is life.</p>
<p>Here I am at the top of the hill in the library and once again 
I'm stuck for a subject. I think a lot of it is because I have 
{word deleted} on my mind. </p>
<p>Right now, it seems to me that I feel like outlining the steps 
to direct mail success so that's what I'm going to do. </p>
<p>Step 1 - Find a hot market (mailing list)</p>
<p>Step 2 - Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) to
sell to that market. </p>
<p>Step 3 - Create a direct mail promotion that describes the 
product (or service) and the benefits of owning the same.</p>
<p>Step 4 - Make a test mailing (1,000 to 5,000 pieces) </p>
<p>Step 5 - Analyze results </p>
<p>Step 6 - If results are good, mail 20,000 to 100,000 more
letters</p>
<p>Step 7 - If results are still good, start rolling out and taking 
care of business </p>
<p>You know, it's really a simple procedure.</p>
<p>If you use good common sense, your chances of success are
excellent. Where people go wrong is by making it too 
complicated. Actually, this is only one of the ways people go
wrong and it occurs to me that it would be helpful to enumerate
the most common reasons for MO &amp; DM failure. </p>
<p>And, toward this end I'm going to tell you about a little
discussion I had just a couple hours ago. What happened is I was 
settling down writing an earlier portion of this letter when a 
friend of mine told me he wanted to chat with me in private. 
(Chat! Isn't that nifty word to describe a prison conversation?) </p>
<p>Anyway, what he wanted to talk about was that a friend of his
had invented a gizmo that lets you make stuff out of wood the
same way a key-making machine lets you make keys out of blank
metal. (Actually, I don't fully understand what this thing does, 
but no matter.)</p>
<p>In any case, he wants me to take a look at the papers on this
thing and see if I think it is worth promoting because the guy 
who invented this thing isn't following through with it because
he can make so much more money smuggling dope. </p>
<p>Of all things! Oh my! Well, what I told him is I would be glad 
to help. However, I also told him that he was making the single
most common mistake made by people who want to break into the MO 
business.</p>
<p>What is that mistake? The mistake is finding or developing a 
product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This
is backasswards. </p>
<p>You Must Always</p>
<p>Find A Market First... </p>
<p>And Then Concentrate On A Product! </p>
<p>Products are a dime a dozen. They are important but much less
crucial to success than finding a hot market. I'll tell you
this: A guy with a new product cannot always find a hot market 
for that product but a guy who has uncovered a HOT MARKET can
always find a product to fill the needs of that market.</p>
<p>I Love You And Good Luck!</p>
<p>Dad</p>
